page,How campuses appear in measurabl,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""Suggested next sections to fill out:\n\n-  Background: How Campuses are created in ESTAR and why\n-  How Meters are pulled into Measurabl\n\nh2. Square Footage Rules\n\nWhen creating a campus in Energy Star, there's not a ton of validation that can prevent odd-ball edge cases from happening. One of those can be when the sub-buildings sum to a different sq ft than the campus. What does Measurabl do then? There's 2 rules:\n\n-  The sub-buildings' sq fts match up to the campus's sq ft exactly, so Measurabl pulls in the campus's sq ft.\n-  The sub-buildings' sq fts *are smaller than* the campus's sq ft, so Measurabl pulls in the campus's sq ft + the sum of the sub-buildings' sq ft. This is because we assume the campus's sq ft must be the extra sq ft that's campus-level but not included in the sub-buildings' sq ft.\n\n*_Example A:_* _Campus has a total sq ft of 500,000 ft2. Its sub-buildings are Building 1 and Building 2, both which have a sq ft of 250,000 ft2. This meets rule 1, and the campus is pulled in as 500,000 ft2._\n\n*_Example B:_* _Campus has a total sq ft of 500,000 ft2. Its sub-buildings are Building 1 and Building 2, but in this example both Building 1 and Building 2 are only 100,000 ft2 each. This meets rule 2, and the campus is pulled in as 700,000 ft2 (=500,000 + 100,000 + 100,000 ft2)._\n\nIn most cases, rule 2 is met accidentally/incorrectly because whoever set up Energy Star didn't set it up well. To fix it, they either need to change the campus's sq ft or the sub-buildings' sq fts.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"
page,2018 intensity calculations,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""***This is the harder but more accurate way to do this. You can alternatively just take the 2016 and 2017 numbers from the PI table, multiply them by 1000 and divide them by the data coverage column to get something in the tables. Intensities are not validated, any answer gets you full points.***\n\n##\n\nh2. Background\n\nThere's a known issue that the calculations for the GRESB intensities do some funky stuff to get to the final numbers ([FR #116|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/feature-requests/tickets/realtime_cardwall?ticket=116]). Briefly, the tenant data is being subtracted from the numerator so any clients with 100% indirectly managed* assets are seeing 0's for their intensity even though they have some tenant data. Technically, the calculation is incorrect for all property types, however, it's most problematic when the intensity is 0 because the client will not receive any points for this scenario. For the 100% indirectly managed scenario, we need to calculate these intensities offline so the client can receive points.\n\n_*Note: This is GRESB terminology that all CS reps should know, but interns don't need to concern themselves with. Basically, the Industrial & Retail assets should be 100% indirectly managed._\n\nh2. Instructions\n\n-  Make a copy of [this template|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V4XB9eSczrDwz_nruYd__H-NvOzdGgB0ufewmWY3BMA/edit#gid=1841608064] and make sure to save it in the associated customer's folder.\n-  Open up the client's group in Admin and head to the Reports page. If they're a long time client they'll have a GRESB 2018 survey in the Active section and some older GRESB surveys in the Archive section. If so, proceed to skip to step #. Otherwise, see step 3.\n-  If you see less than 3 GRESB surveys (2018, 2017, 2016), go to the [Demo Group|https://app.measurabl.com/admin/users/250/groups/11763/reports] Reports page and copy the missing survey to the client's group by clicking the vertical dots and then 'Copy to Another Group'. Search for the POC and then pick the group. Make sure to restart the survey in the client's group before proceeding. Perform this step multiple times for each missing survey.\n-  For every GRESB survey you see, open up the Data Summary section and head to the Performance Indicators section.\n-  Use the drop down at the top of the page to filter to one property type at a time. *This must be performed per property type*. Copy the performance indicator tables for Energy into the '{{Property Type}} - Energy' tab and GHG emissions into '{{Property Type}} - GHG' and the same for Water. If you do not see a tab for the property type, copy the similar tab for a different Property Type and change the tab's name.\n-  Once you've copied and pasted all the metrics for all the GRESB reports, the summary page should update automatically with the calculations. If the values are not updating automatically, check:\n-  That the name of the tab matches what the formula is expecting. *This is not always the exact spelling of the property type* since the names are long and I got tired of typing.\n-  That you copied and pasted *everything* in the right cells. Read the formula if you're confused and if you aren't good at formulas ask someone who is (Brianna, Arielle, Sondra, Dana, Aaron)\n\nh2. Notes\n\n-  If the client has selected a base year for intensities before 2014, Sondra and I are working on how to get those PI numbers so hold on.\n-  You are welcome to perform this task for all property types, not just the indirectly managed ones. Recommendation either way is TBD.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

Downloading it should open it in Chrome too. _(Login>Right-hand Panel select 'Assessment Portal'>Select 2018 box on top line>View Assessment>Print, Print Response>Save PDF)_\n-  If the Response will not download, you will need to use the 2018 response from the Customer's GRESB 2018 folder on the drive.\n-  While logged in, click the Documents icon (make sure you are still on 2018 box) and save off each of the supplemental documents so that you can upload each of these into the new mapping. Make sure you keep the Customer's GRESB 2018 folder updated with anything new you downloaded.\n-  Save off the report in the Customer's GRESB 2018 folder for safe keeping.\n-  Add a new group in MSR with a clear naming convention 'Customer Name X, Fund Name - Mapping'\n-  Create a [split screen|https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204948] on your Mac: one with a group you're in (in MSR) and one with the 2018 GRESB survey you exported from GRESB. The group you use will be where you map the survey so don't pick 'Demo Group' or anything else you use for demos. It should be a throw away group.\n-  It is also helpful to have the [Mapping guide|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I3Q8n0qTbCCdGbWSpUehtexhbfwoPuaD297cmkwL9T4/edit#gid=0] open on another desktop so you can easily reference it\n-  Go to the group you just created in Admin view (Search your name and select the group name under your list of groups). Select 'Report Management' on the left-hand panel. Add the GRESB 2019 survey with the end date = '2019 (2018-12-31)'. The 2019 surveys are different than the pre-release survey.

They should be exactly the same.\n-  If the client's GRESB credentials are failing, ask a CS rep to go into the Measurabl GRESB portal and download the PDF survey for you.\n-  Please save off the PDFs in the customer's folder when done.\n-  If you're unable to download the survey from the GRESB portal due to their server's crashing, check the customer's GRESB 2018 folder to see if there's a copy of the survey in there.\n-  If you're logged in as the client, the links to the supporting evidence will download the PDFs you need for mapping. If the client's credentials are broken, make a new task in Flow about the missing documentation and then complete the rest of the mapping steps without the documents.\n-  You can also access the supporting evidence through the Documents icon pictured above next to the 'Print response or results' icon.\n-  If the first page you see when you login says 'Benchmark Report' instead of 'Real Estate Entities', then click 'Assessment Portal' on the right hand side to get to the correct place for step 1.\n-  For clients using Measurabl as a Data Management system (Pro/Premium) the template can be found here. Main thing is to make sure to highlight the subscription level the client has, replace '{{Client}}' with the client's name, and change the screenshot to a screenshot of the client's account in Measurabl as proof. Convert it to a PDF before uploading it to GRESB for submission.\n\nh2. Completion\n\nA complete mapping for 2019 is if you completed one of these scenarios:\n\n1. You were able to login as the client and grab the 2018 survey (either from GDrive or the portal), where you used the mapping guide to map to the GRESB 2019 survey in Measurabl with all the documentation from the GRESB portal\n\n2. You were able to login as the client but couldn’t access the 2018 survey in the GRESB portal nor was there a copy in the GDrive, so you used the GRESB portal’s 2019 mapping with all the documents relevant for the 2019 survey.\n\nIf at any point you used the “Documents” section of the GRESB portal to extract documentation and you saw the word “missing” for certain question numbers, you went to the 2019 documents portal, not the 2018 portal as needed for option 1. The 2019 Documents portal is fine for option 2 above. Everything is done if you mapped all the documents in the 2019 Documents section when completing option 2.

ARDEM Bill Digitization\n\n*Summary*: ARDEM is a partner used in Utility Sync but there is a separate workflow to support ARDEM's help extracting waste data from utility bills. ARDEM reads the bill, extracts the data, and delivers it back to Measurabl in a CSV, which is downloaded by Brianna and a CS rep/intern/data engineer reformats and uploads to Energy Star directly.\n\n*Frequency of deliveries*: Once a quarter? Or month?\n\n*Data host*: Energy Star\n\n*Steps to set up*:\n\n_Note: at the time of writing this, there's no way for clients to upload bills in Measurabl so steps below reflect an alternative workflow. Here's the feature request for the Offline Bill UI feature:_ [_FR #26_|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/feature-requests/tickets/realtime_cardwall?ticket=26]_._\n\n-  Confirm with Brianna/Marc/Dana before setting this up as this is not a full fledged feature just yet.\n-  Ask the client to send you the PDF bills to be processed via email or Box.com account.\n-  Post in the #ardem channel that you have some bills to be processed by Ardem. Specify 1) how many bills 2) any expectations of timeline for data 3) what Utility Sync ID is associated with the group you want the data delivered to. (Admin > Utility Sync > Clients > Sync Id column).\n-  They will download the bills and upload it to the sFTP site that we share with ARDEM. Then Brianna will email ARDEM and notify them of bill deliveries.\n-  ARDEM needs a few days notice before they can plan to process a large amount of bills (2,000+ bills)\n-  ARDEM will send a CSV to a specific waste folder that is *not* automatically processed, but USync Admins will be alerted when data is delivered in the #ardem-alerts channel.\n-  Brianna downloads the Waste file and a ton of data quality is performed on the file before reformatting into the Energy Star waste data import template and uploaded directly to Energy Star manually.\n-  Note: This has only been done for ARE so far and a couple weeks in we still haven't finished waste data quality clean up so there's no identified process for this yet which is why the instructions for this step are vague.\n-  Waste bills are notoriously hard to process as they may have weight information, but most likely the bill could only have container size & frequency of pickups or just cost information with nothing else. We can only upload data that has container size & frequency of pickups or weight information.\n\nh2. 3. Manual Upload to Energy Star\n\n*Summary*: Since we don't have options for Waste automation yet, secretly for the top clients, we've been taking their waste data and uploading directly to Energy Star. It's not ideal since it's a workaround to the problem of site managers not being able to enter waste data into Measurabl if the site is also set up in Energy Star (aka Utility Sync), but it's the best way to service our clients today.\n\n*Frequency of deliveries*: Once a quarter\n\n*Data host*: Energy Star\n\n*Steps to set up*:\n\n-  Gather excel of waste data from Premium clients. It can come in whatever format they have, but it's recommended that you generate an [Energy Star template|https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pm/dataimport/createTemplate] so it's easier to plug and play their data without reformatting. This may be difficult to perform regularly but as a one off task, it's great.\n-  Fill out the Energy Star templates and upload it to Energy Star. Follow instructions in Energy Star to fix any errors that may arise from the upload\n-  Once you see a successful upload in Energy Star, share these new meters to Measurabl or they won't appear in the client's account (step is only required if upload is done in the client's Energy Star account vs Measurabl's Energy Star account). To share the meters:\n-  Click the 'Sharing' tab and click the second big blue button 'Set up Web Services/Data Exchange'\n-  In Part 1, choose 'Measurabl Measurabl'. In Part 2, choose the sites you just added waste too. In Part 3, select 'I want to set permission levels in bulk for all selected properties and meters.' and then 'Exchange Data Full Access'. Then click 'Authorize Exchange'.\n-  If you see a page that asks to confirm updates to existing shares, select 'Continue'. Otherwise, you'll just get a confirmation message.\n-  If you see an error saying the server is busy, then you may be attempting to share too much data at once. Energy Star has a limit of so many readings to be shared in bulk at once. You may have to go back to step 3b and select a smaller set of sites multiple times to do all the shares needed.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

It was far too challenging for real estate owners/organizations to collect and manage (& thus report) their sustainability data. If they were collecting, the manual upload (excel) was extremely time consuming and left too much room for human error. With this in mind, Matt set out to find a way to automate that data collection while also procuring the data to make sure it’s of Investment-Grade quality. Once you have the right data, we make that data proactive and allow it to work for you (Trends/Analytics/Benchmarking).\n\nReporting: GRESB, CDP, GRI\n\nRole & Mission of the SDR:\n\n-  Contact and qualify prospects with the goal of setting discovery calls for AE\n-  Push discovery calls to demos with AE\n\n--  See 'SDR Deal Process Workflow' for specifics on how prospects should flow through the sales team\n\nWhere Leads Derive From:\n\n-  The Sales Funnel\n\n--  Leads > *MQL*\n\n--  Leads will naturally push through the funnel based on interaction\n--  SDRs will call on New Marketing Qualified Leads\n-  Drift\n\n--  Our online bot\n-  LinkedIn Navigator (Prospecting tool)\n\n--  Navigator searches\n-  #Slack\n\n--  Customer activity channel\n\n--  New User Accounts Created\n--  Matt's Prospects from his LinkedIn\n\n--  Add these to HubSpot\n-  Campaigns\n\n--  Past Closed-Recycled Deals\n--  Conferences\n\n--  i.e.BOMA\n--  Events\n--  Campaigns\n\n--  GRESB\n\nDay in the life of the SDR:\n\n-  Managing your prospects/leads (Using HubSpot to do so)\n\n--  Calls/Emails\n\n--  First touches, follow ups, providing content \n    - Keep warm touches warm.

An aggregator site is someone who stores scanned images of utility bills from multiple vendors\n-  Username & Password : every account you are trying to activate through Urjanet has to have functioning(valid) credentials - username & password\n-  Language : Currently Urjanet only supports Latin/UTF-8 languages\n-  Bill Format : Urjanet supports & prefers pdf's(for ease of extraction & quality of bill) but also extracts data from html pages. If you have a vendor whose bills are not in pdf/html, please check with USync team\n-  Data-fields : Usage is a must(Energy Star requires Usage to store any data), along with an Account Number, Statement Start & End date*(some vendors only display statement-date - statement start & end can be extrapolated from this) & Cost\n-  Website Blockers : The vendor's/aggregator's website should not have any restrictions on who is trying to access the site or from where they are trying to log-on. For example, some websites only work if they are accessed from a US IP address\n-  History(previous statements) : Vendor should make available history statements through the website at no extra cost. Sustainability reports absolutely have to have history statements(full calendar year data) unless the account you are trying to activate only has data from the middle of the year\n-| Utility Type : Urjanet currently supports all typical energy service types : Electricity, Natural Gas, Water | Sewer, District Heating etc. If you have a service type that is not common, please check with USync team |\n\n2. *Offline Extraction*\n\nThis is primarily through our OCR(Optical Character Recognition) partner : Ardem, who specializes in digitizing data from pdf scans of utility bills.\n\nPre-requisites with this mode of data extraction:\n\n-  Format of the bill : has to be a scan of the utility bill in pdf format\n-  Scan quality : best possible(300 dpi) quality without any markings, smudges etc. that would reduce the chance of extracting all the key data-points\n-  Data-fields : Usage is a must(Energy Star requires Usage to store any data), along with an Account Number, Statement Start & End date*(some vendors only display statement-date - statement start & end can be extrapolated from this)\n-  Language : Currently we only support Latin/UTF-8 script scans for Ardem processing\n-  Number of invoices/pdf scan : Every scan being submitted for Ardem/offline processing has to follow the 1:1 rule - 1 utility bill per pdf.

Intuitively? That makes it easy to report on one or many or custom groups of properties? There were a lot of problems the new nav was out to solve, and they are hard problems, and I think they did a good job covering a lot of ground.\n-  I like how they took the list of assets out of the left hand nav and gave it it's own place - a secondary nav that sits to the right of the primary nav, accessible via one click: 'Home'\n\n--  It makes it much easier to sort, select, filter a lit of properties\n-  After some thought, I'm definitely curious of the data: how many users _really_ have 600 properties?\n\n--  From experience, I know one of the larger clients at VTS is RMR - 600+ properties, and the only person (or people) with access to _all_ are Super Admins - e.g. users who aren't completing deal workflows or monitoring their rent roll or lease expirations\n--  Something we can do is understand: what's our Site Manager-to-building ratio? How robust does _our_ new nav need to be?\n-  On a note beyond the new nav, I notice VTS has a _ton_ of data on each of their pages, especially their main landing pages: deals/assets. Lots of rows and top-level, rolled up metrics . At first I thought, is this overwhelming to the user? Maybe all that data is required. I know one of their main sources of inspirations, or goals for that matter, is to be like Bloomberg. And from what I've seen of Bloomberg, there is _a lot_ of data on a single screen.. and maybe their users need to see all that, all at once. Something we can think about - what data does a Site Manger or Portfolio _need_ to see, or combination of data sets, to get their job done as quickly, easily and enjoyable as possible?\n\nFeel free to add more thoughts after you watch.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Data check,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h2. Background:\n\nA Data Check is a performed for a Pro/Premium client within the month of March to assess the health and completeness of the data that will be reported to GRESB and/or CDP. A combination of Data Quality alerts are used across the client's portfolio to find anomalous months of data or any sites that are missing data for reporting.\n\nh2. How it works:\n\nA series of data quality rules are checked across every month for every active site within the client's account. These are the type of alerts that could be generated:\n\n-  *Intensity*: If a building's monthly consumption per square footage is higher than a scientific range of acceptable consumption for a building of similar type (i.e. Office). _Limitations_: 1) Does not review low intensities 2) Does not take into account meter allocations or GLA 3) Does not review waste data.\n-  *Month-over-Month (MOM):* If a month within a building has massively increased or decreased in relation to the previous year's consumption for the same month (i.e. if consumption has doubled between Feb 2016 and Feb 2017, then Feb 2017 will flag). _Limitations_: 1) Does not take into account occupancy, lifecycle, or weather changes 2) The alert will not tell you which is the anomalous month 3) Does not review waste data.\n-  *Cost per Unit (CPU)*: If the consumption for the month changes abnormally in relation to the cost, then we know either consumption is captured incorrectly, the units are captured incorrectly, or cost was captured incorrectly. Science has determined what a 'normal' cost per unit ratio is, and if any readings break those rules, then they are flagged. _Limitations_: 1) Does not review readings with consumption or cost >= 0, 2) Readings without cost are ignored 3) Does not review waste data.\n-  *Missing Data:* If there's less months of data than the number of months of ownership, the building will flag but it won't tell you where the missing data is. This is the only alert associated with our old Data Quality alerts that are building level instead of month level, so it requires more investigation. The alerts assume all buildings should have electric and water data, but District, Fuel, and Waste will only flag if there was a gap. _Limitations_: 1) Does not tell you what months of data are missing 2) Separate place for generation.\n\nThese alerts are currently being generated every night on each group's Data Anomalies page automatically (no ad-hoc request button yet). That means, that if the sync from Energy Star hasn't been refreshed in 3 days, the alerts are based on 3 day old data. Also, our importer from Energy Star on the Data page *does not* import readings with negative consumption so some gaps may be due to our importer ignoring a negative consumption reading ([FR#223|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/feature-requests/tickets/realtime_cardwall?ticket=223]).\n\nTechnical wiki on how the anomalies are detected and on how Scott pulls the list: https://app.tettra.co/teams/measurabl/pages/site-anomaly-detector?utm_campaign=team-37251&utm_medium=notification&utm_source=slack&token=d90753a6b7c94dcc323576963698b8d1d73145efbd9c39d3b06dbd23929ca244\n\nDescription of the alerts you can provide to clients and auditors:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bf6j_O5mxmoD-wpewmI7Dn5V7kQbAcYUVHiepcqAA7Q/edit#gid=862117861\n\nh2. Steps to Perform a Data Check:\n\n-  Clone [this template|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10F9vPxyanvwKf-6VC4MZN5uxoQYuwMjpfgev819Uj3U/edit#gid=1230002384] and rename with your client's name and the date you generated the alerts\n-  Download the list of sites from the Import/Export page and paste values into columns A through K on the 'Sites' tab. Columns L through P have formulas and will update automatically but make sure to drag the formulas all the way down to all rows. _Hint:_ There should be a '1' in column L for each row you paste.\n-  Head to the group(s) in Admin and then click on the 'Data Anomalies' page to see the most up-to-date list of anomalies. Download this list and paste it into B through G on the 'Data Quality Alerts' tab. _Note:_  Column A ('#') can either be the unique ID for the issue or the severity  whatever you think your client would like to see. You're also welcome to delete that column. Interns, paste the severity here and CS reps will remove/change as needed.\n-  Review all the data quality alerts and fill out I through L. See the 'How to review each anomaly type' below for detailed instructions.\n-  Go to the Data Anomalies Page (App Admin > Client > Data Anomalies ) and Export\n-  Make sure the Report End Date box says '2017-12-31' and then select the rule you want to generate. You will do one at a time (7 total):\n-  *Waste*:\n\n--  _GRESB Waste Outlier Intensity_: Checks if the annual waste intensity for 2017 or 2016 is above 400 MT/sqft.\n--  _GRESB Waste YoY Change_: Checks if the annual data between 2017 and 2016 has increased or decreased more than 50%.\n-  *Missing Data*:\n\n--  _GRESB Electric/Water Missing Data:_ Triggers if sites have gaps or no electric data\n--  _GRESB Fuel/District Missing Data:_ Triggers only if site has gaps in data\n--  _GRESB Waste Missing Data:_  Triggers only if there's data for 2016 but not for 2017 and vice versa\n-  One by one, generate the rule for the group, download the results to a CSV (results will only be Site & Rule Name) and then reformat the Waste ones into the 'Data Quality Alerts' format and paste to that tab. Please split the rule name into metric and anomaly type, i.e. 'GRESB Waste Intensity Outlier' should be metric = 'Waste' and anomaly type 'Intensity'.\n-  Paste the Missing Data alerts into the 'Missing Data' tab (columns A through E) and then fill out columns F & G. See the 'How to review each anomaly type' below for detailed instructions. Instead of pasting the whole rule name, simply paste the metric type in the metric column.\n-  The Summary tab should update automatically with all the data needed, including a Pass Rate with conditional formatting.

Error, this means there are not enough rows for how much data needs to be populated (insert more rows until it works)\n--  Check that all titles match accordingly & that all conditional formatting works\n\nh2. How to Review Each Anomaly Type:\n\nGeneral Steps:\n\n-  Open one tab for the Data page where you can pick the site and then head to the Site Trends page to view the graph and see if anything visually looks off (i.e. a large jump or drop).\n-  If the site is on Utility Sync, open another tab to the group's Meter Status page (i.e. [this|https://app.measurabl.com/admin/users/1394/groups/11476/data/syncId/146/meter-status]) so you can quickly access the bills for any of the meters on Utility Sync.\n-  If the site is not on Utility Sync, do your best to identify the issue visually, but if the issue isn't obvious, the Status should be 'Pending' and the Issue should be 'Unconfirmed'. CS reps will review this with the client during the meeting.\n-  Always use the Explanation field to put your notes for what you found, it should never be blank.\n\nLet's discuss the types of Analysis options and when you should select them:\n\nKnowing all the Issue options, let's use them to review our anomaly types:\n\nh2. General Notes & Hints:\n\n-  Don't spend more than 1 minute per anomaly. If it isn't obvious how to mark the status, run it by someone for help or just leave it as 'Pending' and 'Unconfirmed'.\n-  Meters starting with 'MSR' are from Utility Sync. All Measurabl meters are formatted like 'MSR.{{Provider Name}} {{Account Number}}:{{Meter Number}}'.\n-  The new data anomaly feature doesn't export the admin link. Use the following function to get the admin link *= concatenate('https://app.measurabl.com/admin/users/(ENTER THE USER ID)/groups/(ENTER THE GROUP NUMBER)/data-management/real-estate/ENERGYSTAR/', vlookup(Building name, ARRAY W/ BUILDING NAME AND ID, 2,0),'/trends'*\n-  Keep updating this spreadsheet with notes as you learn things!\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Usync data modification utility bill measurabl,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""Here are all the business rules on scenarios where data is modified for invoices processed through Utility Sync:\n\nh2. *Usage*\n\n*Usage Allocation by Meter:* If an invoice has more than one meter and the usage is not allocated per each meter - then the total usage is equally distributed across all the meters.\n\n*Usage for Generation Accounts:* A user can mark an account in Measurabl as 'Generation', which will zero out the consumption and keep the cost. This is to ensure the consumption between Transmission and Generation do not duplicate.\n\n*Usage for Sewer Meters:* If the reading comes back as type 'sewer', Measurabl will replace the consumption with 0 but keep the cost. This is because sewer consumption is generally a sub-meter of water consumption (sewer = water export vs water = water import  can't export without import).\n\n*UOM Conversions:*\n\nh2. *Cost*\n\n*Cost Allocation:* If an invoice has multiple meters and the total cost is not allocated by the meter, a meter-level cost is computed by splitting the total cost proportionally to the meter's usage.\n\n*Non-Usage Costs:*  Non-usage related costs such as late fees, credits, or balances are not included in the meter costs when split out and identified on the bill.\n\n*Currency:* We use the ECB reference rates, which are updated every day. The statement end-date dictates which day's conversion rate is used. All invoices with currency not in USD, are converted into USD to be stored into our system.\n\nh2. *Statement Span*\n\n*64-day split:* If the reading spans more than 64 days (end date minus start date is greater than 64 days), the readings are split into multiple invoices(with a distinct number of days) to be stored into ENERGY STAR.\n\nExample : For example if the utility bill is for 80 calendar days, our system tries to split into equal parts(with no reading exceeding 64 days) and every reading ending up with a distinct number of days. In this example, a possible split for the 80 calendar days is 41 and 39.\n\nUsage & Costs are pro-rated at the meter-level in the same ratio as how the meter readings were split - based on the above example the total usage and cost are split 41:39.\n\n*Gap/Overlap - 4 day rule*: If there is a gap/overlap in data between two invoice periods that does not exceed 4 calendar days. This is a necessary step to prevent data gap warnings(which would prevent a score) on ENERGY STAR.\n\nExample : Overlap - The end dates are adjusted, as long as the difference is within the 4 calendar day limit\n\nInvoice #1 - 1/1/2018 - 2/4/2018 & Invoice #2 - 2/1/2018-3/2/2018\n\nThis results in an overlap between 2/1/2018 to 2/4/2018, since more than 1 invoice is reporting for this time span. Our logic would adjust the readings to be 1/1/2018 - 2/1/2018 & 2/1/2018 - 3/2/2018\n\nExample : Gap - we fill in readings with '0' usage and '0' cost to maintain continuity.\n\nInvoice #1 - 1/1/2018 - 1/30/2018 & Invoice #2 - 2/3/2018 - 3/2/2018\n\nOur automation logic would introduce a 3rd invoice in between # 1 & #2 with zero usage & cost.\n\nThat would look like 1/30/2018 - 2/3/2018\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Value propositions conversation,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""*Utility Sync: Matt*\n\n-  Question: Do you think your property managers should know what they use/spend on a monthly basis? Yes or no? If “yes', then 'are they going about this in a scalable automated way?'\n-  Pain: If second answer is “no” then point out that the PMs are wasting the prospect's money and their own time. Not to mention they're creating errors that can catch up to the owner when they go to sell the building or report its performance.\n-  Math: A typical property manager’s salary is $40/hr. They take on average 2 hours every month to track utility data\n-  Timeline: Monthly benefit from cost savings, better intelligence, better reporting.\n\n*ENERGY STAR: Drew & Gabe*\n\n-  As Sean wrote, tracking and monitoring building performance is the first step for organizations to take on their sustainability journey. Energy Star is a government entity that allows owners and occupiers the opportunity to do this free of charge. Regulatory Tracking also comes into play with Energy Star because for organizations to meet the requirements of specific ordinances they must be uploading data to Energy Star. Measurabl provides value for organizations whether or not they already have an Energy Star Portfolio account. We just have to ask the question.\n\nEnergy Star:\n\n-  Question: Do you currently upload data to E* PM? Yes or No?\n-  If yes, Measurbal provides value by eliminating the hassle of collecting and manually uploading data. Through utility sync, that data will easily and efficiently flow into both platforms. Other benefits that provide additional value are:\n\n--  Tenant Spaces\n--  Site Manager delegation\n--  Site speed and user-friendly\n-  If no, not to worry! Measurabl automatically syncs with E* so as your data flows into MSR it will also be uploaded to E*.\n\n*Regulatory tracking: Drew & Gabe*\n\n-  As more and more municipalities begin to pass city/statewide ordinances, Measurabl will make sure that your assets and portfolio is meeting the specific data and reporting requirements. This removes the burden off of our clients and eliminates the stress that comes with staying current with government law.\n\nValue\n\n-  Time savings (due to streamlined processes)\n-  Peace of mind (Knowing that you're using high quality data and statuses for the multitude of requirements )\n-  Quality Assurance (Data alerts to ensure high quality data)\n\n*Audit/project tracking: Mel*\n\n-  *_Question:_* Do you track projects and audits for your portfolio? Yes or no? If 'yes', then 'how are you tracking?' \\\nAnswer 'Xls, survey at year end, or some archaic way'\n-  *_Question_*: What happens when a site completes a project during the year? Do you have insight? Manually add to this XLS? Only insight into this once a year when your team collects via XLS?\n-  *_Pain:_* Lack of timely insight and using out of date data if looking at last year's data collection.\n-  Have no insight into projects going on across portfolio to report out quarterly.\n-  *_Benefits:_*\n-  *Awareness* - Automatic global insight into projects - View and sort by project status, cost, vendors, KWH saved, etc.\n-  *Save time, internal efficiencies, time value of money*  - Save time and create efficient process - Properties enter MSR during project instead of waiting for you to ask your properties if they have completed project.\n-  *Engagement* - Vendor Engagement and oversight - invite your service providers who completes the projects to Measurabl. They will add the project details which gives you access to track and report projects to GRESB, CDP, investor reports.\n\n*Ad hoc reports (site/portfolio): Chase*\n\n-  We know it to be true that there is great value in understanding how your portfolio, and at a more granular level, each of your individual sites are performing. For organizations who lack a sustainability management software, creating portfolio and site level reports is a burdensome and time consuming process that often requires sustainability professionals to migrate information from multiple different data sources into Excel to create a report. Human error can result during this tedious process which could lead to making business decisions, such as an expensive project implementation, on inaccurate information.\n-  Measurabl eliminates the pain, burden and inaccuracies associated with manually putting together portfolio and site level reports by providing out-of-the-box, ad hoc sustainability reports that can be exported at the click of a button. The report data is comprehensive and quality assured so organizations can easily share information internally and rest assured that the decisions they make are supported by correct data. Additionally, sustainability professionals will get back a few hours each month to focus on more important aspects of their work than report creation.\n\n*Peer benchmarking: Sean*\n\n-  Tracking and monitoring building performance is the first step any entity takes on their sustainability journey. Further, the process is far more streamlined with technology that aids in the data collection and management process. However, it's easy to fall into the trap of thinking 'wow, I reduced my energy consumption by 3% compared to last year! We must be doing great!' Yes, while it is important to have goals and targets, it's _more important to map those targets against how that entity's peers/competitors are performing._\n\n--  Why? Investors have a large marketplace of entities/asset managers to choose from when engaging in capital allocation. As a result, Investors want to know which asset managers will provide low risk adjusted returns on their investment. Therefore, _understanding how an entity/asset manager performs relative to its peers helps investors assess risk and cost of capital._ This also empowers the entity/asset manager to evaluate which aspects of its properties across the portfolio are performing poorly and take action (e.g. implement efficiency projects), which makes them more sustainable and attractive to prospective Investors.\n\n*'I think I Need a Consultant': Matt's Bonus*\n\n-  What I mean is we often hear “I need a consultant”. That is not true. Do you need a consultant to run your leasing, or your day to day operations? Of course not, you use technology like Yardi or MRI for that. Why would you treat other critical aspects like sustainability any differently? Why would you outsource that and be wholly reliant on a firm or person that can go away..?\n-  The industry is becoming digital and fast paced. Measurabl is the best in class software for sustainability. You can internalize that function and scale it using software. A consultant does not do that for you.\n-  The costs of not doing this are almost unquantifiable. What’s the cost of not being able to transact an asset at its maximum value because you can’t show or track its sustainability performance?\n-  The time aspect is also huge. What’s the time of having to ask a consultant who has to ask excel who has to generate a costume report and has to send that back and you’re not sure what you’re going to get vs logging in yourself and getting exactly what you need when you need it?\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,The vision of measurabl according to matt,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""I figured I'd take this opportunity to do some mind melding on how we can try to cut a very specific “Measurabl” value proposition into this backdrop of “green”, “sustainable”, “low carbon buildings” etc What I mean by that is sustainability is clearly a rising tide that is lifting boats across many sectors around the world, Measurabl being one. Our challenge and opportunity is to communicate how Measurabl is the essential tool for building owners and occupiers (two distinct target markets) to fundamentally collect their sustainability data, analyze and report it and, ultimately, drive action around it so they improve.\n\nThere are a lot of solutions, primarily energy management solutions, that create noise and can distract and confuse our target clients. We need to be understood as very differentiated in what we do - THE global platform for building benchmarking, THE place to collect and quality assure your ESG data, THE place you secure an Investment Grade rating trusted by lenders like Fannie Mae, insurers like AIG, or ratings agencies like S&P etc. This last part is the trickiest to understand and probably or greatest opportunity.\n\nAll this will take time for me to fully convey but the short of it is that our solution and value proposition are defined by a few things including the fact that we're used across whole portfolios of real estate, not really individual buildings although that is technically possible, and we help those portfolios, whether institutionally owned or just leased by corporations, understand their environmental and social impacts and accurately communicate them to investors. That last part is perhaps the most unusual thing about us and where we aspire to go as a company: most solutions play “inside' the building and 'behind the utility meter”, giving owners some sense of utility consumption in real time as a result. We don’t (not yet at least..). Instead, we take data from the all meters and assets in a portfolio and add value by putting that performance in context or our uniquely large data set of >5B square feet and trusted, Investment Grade quality assurance processes. These are things other companies simply cannot do or, right now, even attempt to lay claim to because they are focused on basic things like energy savings.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

Every day the integration between Yardi and Measurabl produces a list of alerts that require action in order for data to appear correctly in Measurabl. Reconciliation of these alerts should be conducted at least quarterly.\n\nh2. Preparation Steps\n\n1) Join #yardi-alerts in Slack\n\n2) Download the Postman app https://www.getpostman.com/apps\n\n3) Ask @john for link to integration (RREEF's looks like this: https://www.yardipca.com/58415rreef/Webservices/RREEFMeasurabl.asmx)\n\n4) Download yardi2csv.py from https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1N4nplXzJnLNjql6kTyqhNTPrKJx7JV3O (this is a script written by John that transforms the yardi xml file into csv) and save it in your Downloads folder\n\nh2. What Each Anomaly Means\n\n*Bad Properties:* This indicates an issue within the Yardi system. No action is required by Measurabl.\n\n*Bad Property Data:* This indicates an issue within the Yardi system. No action is required by Measurabl.\n\n*Missing Buildings:* This is a list of building ID's (same as ESTAR ID's) that had previously been mapped in Measurabl but are not properties in Measurabl anymore. You may wish to check this list with the customer in case they'd like those properties in Measurabl again in the future.\n\n*Bad GLAs:* This tells you which buildings have a GFA in Yardi which exceeds the GLA values for the same property in Measurabl. You will need to use the Yardi Raw Export to determine the most current GFA that should be used instead of the outdated figure.\n\n*Unmapped Yardi properties*: In order to form a link between Yardi and Measurabl, it's necessary to 'map' the site ID in Measurabl to the Yardi ID number for the same property. Each Yardi ID needs a Site ID match in Measurabl in order for it to be mapped over correctly. In the case of campuses, there may be multiple Yardi ID's linked to a single campus property Site ID in Measurabl.\n\nh2.

You tab list should be:\n\n-  Yardi Raw Export\n-  MSR Site Export (from Import/Export)\n-  MSR to Yardi Mapping (from Admin view of group, click Yardi)\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89908/wx0u1wsduj4o4wEhWltHGc2N0IedObJW3LscmplL.png|alt=wx0u1wsduj4o4wEhWltHGc2N0IedObJW3LscmplL.png!2) Create a fourth tab called BAD GLA when you'll work through alerts of that type. You can find the full list of alerts in #yardi-alerts and copy them to this tab.\n\na) Use Text to Columns function to separate all pieces of information (Source, Building ID, % Difference in Floor Area)\n\nb) Create columns for Property Name, Inactive/Active, MSR GLA, Calculated GLA, and Yardi Raw GLA\n\nc) Use vlookup functions for Property Name, Inactive/Active, and MSR GLA from the MSR Site Export tab\n\nd) Multiply the % Diff value by the MSR GLA to get the Calculated GLA - this is important as a cross-check against the Yardi Raw GFA which should be the same as the Calculated GLA\n\ne) Navigate to the MSR to Yardi Mapping tab to add a column and vlookup for Yardi GFA based on the Yardi ID number (this will help simplify your need to reference multiple tabs for every answer)\n\nf) Go back to the Bad GLA tab and add a final column called Yardi Raw GFA, using the vlookup you created in step e to populate this column\n\ng) If the calculated and Yardi columns are equal, you've successfully tracked down the correct GLA. That means you can confirm with the customer and upload the new GFA in the system. In other cases you will need to do a deeper dive to see what might be the cause of the difference.\n\n3) Lastly update your MSR to Yardi Mapping, adding onto the list with any of the 'Unmapped Yardi Properties' and making note of rows where the 'Missing Building' alert came up.\n\na) Unmapped Yardi Properties means you should find the right Site ID to match the Yardi ID\n\nb) Missing Buildings have likely been removed from Measurabl, so the mapping is not required anymore\n\nh2. Part 3 - Closing out issues\n\nA - Review Yardi Wiki to add your mapping\n\nB - Use bulk upload to update GLA's\n\nC - Contact @John Schroeder if you have questions\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Ghg emissions scope 123,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h2. Videos:\n\nHere are two quick vids to watch that explain the below concepts:\n\n(High-level concepts for newbies) The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Scopes 1, 2, and 3 Explained: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdPEG028U9o\n\n(Wonkier details for those who want to know a little bit more) How to Calculate Greenhouse Gas Emissions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zq5wTjvLqnY\n\nh2. Background\n\nGreen House Gas (GHG) emissions are the calculation of the amount of carbon emissions that are released as a result of consuming, buying, or influencing energy data (electricity, district, or fuel). Our clients use the Operational control boundary, which means the report on the emissions for activities over which they have direct control (buildings the own or spaces they occupy and cars they own and service).\n\nFrequently, you'll see GHG Emissions talked about in reference to 3 categories:\n\n-  *Scope 1*: Direct emissions you *_burn_*\n-  *Scope 2*: Second-level indirect emissions you *_buy_*\n-  *Scope 3*: Beyond second-level indirect emissions you *_influence_*\n\nSo what do those definitions above mean? Well here's the easy trick for remembering:\n\n-  *Scope 1*: Anything you *_burn_*, aka Natural Gas consumption. When you use natural gas, you're literally putting fire to oil and that reaction causes smoke aka emissions.\n-  *Scope 2:* Anything you *_buy_* where they burn gas directly, aka Electricity + District (steam, chilled water, etc) consumption. Electricity companies typically use dirty coal to fuel their factories so that electricity can be generated in mass for residents nearby. When you use or purchase electricity, you are indirectly producing emissions because the more electricity you use, the more the electricity company has to make more electricity, and the more emissions they produce.\n-  *Scope 3:* Any other type of indirect emissions that you *_influence_*, commonly tenant energy consumption, employee travel to work, airplane flights, etc. In these scenarios, the tenant or employee's direct Scope 1 or Scope 2 emissions are your Scope 3 emissions because you can't control what they do in their personal lives but because they use your site or work for you, you have influence with these stakeholders. You can provide incentives to your tenants to use less electricity or water by rewarding them with lower rent, for example. Or perhaps you create amazing parking spots to employees who carpool. When you provide these incentives, you're likely to influence at least some small percentage of your stakeholders to use less and that makes our planet cleaner.\n\nAs the world cares more about reducing GHG emissions either directly or indirectly, new electricity needs have appeared, such as Solar and Wind Electricity (electricity generated by solar panels or wind farms). These alternatives don't use coal or gas to generate their factories, they use things that naturally happen on this planet. So the GHG emissions for this type of Electricity is 0 MTCO2e (Metric Tons of CO2 equivalent). These are examples of *renewable electricity*. Problem is, this type of electricity is usually far more expensive so it's less adopted than it should be.\n\nSome other people are trying to achieve the 0 MTCO2e emissions by purchasing Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) or other carbon credits that are essentially donations to the government in return for a certificate saying the emissions produced by the company have been forgiven. Though this does nothing to actually reduce emissions, it does benefit the client come reporting time.\n\nh2. GRESB Calculations\n\nMeasurabl reports GHG emissions to both CDP and GRESB, but the data will look differently. In GRESB, we report GHG emissions in the Performance Indicators section per property type. Measurabl auto-calculates the emissions based of energy consumption and meter allocations. Here are the details:\n\n-  Electric + District meters allocated as 'Whole Site' or 'Common Area' are calculated as Scope 2 .\n-  Fuel meters allocated as 'Whole Site' or 'Common Area' are calculated as Scope 1.\n-  Any non-renewable Energy meters marked as 'Tenant Paid by Landlord' or 'Tenant Paid by Tenant' are calculated as Scope 3. If the client has no Tenant meters, but has indicated there's tenant space in the site, the tenant sqft will appear in the 'Total Portfolio' column for Scope 3 without usage.\n-  If there are any renewable meters in Measurabl (solar or wind), they have no emissions so don't appear anywhere on this page.\n-  If there are any RECs or carbon credits purchased, Sondra will calculate those figures offline and report them in the rows for GRESB asking for total MWh of carbon credits.\n\n_Note: In 2018, GRESB began rewarding responders for reporting tenant data by providing a few points for reporting some tenant data. That means clients that do not have any tenant data tracked could be losing out on points._\n\nh2. CDP Calculations\n\nThe CDP survey is short for the 'Carbon Disclosure Project', so its whole focus is on carbon. That means there are many more questions on carbon emissions sliced and diced in many ways. Check out the Data Summary page in the CDP survey to see how the data is broken out.\n\nHere's what Measurabl supports in app:\n\n-  CDP emissions by country\n-  CDP emissions by activity (type of energy data)\n-  CDP emissions by facility (aka per site)\n-  Location-based emissions\n-  Intensities of MTCO2e/sqft\n\nAll Scope 3 figures (except tenant usage which our system automatically calculates) are calculated offline by Sondra and input into the CDP survey. There's no way to view Scope 3 emissions anywhere in Measurabl outside of the Scope 3 calculations for GRESB, which only includes one type of Scope 3 emissions (tenant energy consumption).

This is ok.\n\n*Example:*\n\n*Shorenstein Response Check call 2018* - [video recording |https://recordings.join.me/cr3PRZHifUiq1kREdPxbjA]\n\n[Response Check documents |https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1nA7slzfF1VY_CirwspCjxWrA0tuFoB59]\n\nh2. *Steps to perform to create Response Check document:*\n\n-  Clone [this template|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11muJh3llzWtdsH10zyB7GIofxpxdJJMhYE0F9_-pi7I/edit#gid=1230002384] and rename with your client's name and the date you are completing check on. Save in client's folder. GRESB - 2018\n-  Download word doc version of client's report - in MSR, Reports - GRESB - Overview - Export (right hand corner).\n-  GRESB Response Check Review gsheet - all review will be completed in tab 'Guidance Checklist (enter status and CS notes)'\n-  Open two screens - 1) Client's GRESB report 2) Above Gsheet\n\n--  In column 'status' for each question based on reviewing columns E, F, H - you will be able to enter:\n\n--  If answer is blank or totally wrong - mark 'Requires Action'\n--  If any 'concern' that it does not - mark 'Requires Review'\n--  If answer is good - mark 'Successfully completed'\n--  In column 'Customer Success Notes' - add any clarification notes to guide customer on what may be missing from their answer. Do not spend more than 2 minutes on analyzing questions.\n-  Summary tab will be auto populated with the details you enter above; however, you'll need to create a vlookup to transfer the customer success notes tracked on 'Guidance Checklist' tab to 'Summary' tab. Clients may find this sheet easier to look at, if so we provide both.\n-  Map Performance Indicator data to GRESB portal\n\n-  Open GRESB portal and Client's response check side by side. If you see the tables are pretty much identical to GRESB portal. Copy and paste answers into tables in GRESB.\n-  The purpose of this is to see if alerts come up - if alerts do come up, you will add this to the specific Performance Indicator section in GRESB response check gsheet\n\nh2. Before the call:\n\n*Review Response check with other CS rep:*\n\n-  Schedule 15 minutes the day before the call to walk through high-level the findings of the check\n-  Get feedback from CS rep\n-  If you are a veteran in RC (Bri/Mel), and you don't need to have a 15 min check in. Then ok.\n\nh2. During the call:\n\n-  Review process of what is goes into the response check (client's appreciate hearing you spent time looking at their report)\n-  Top areas for improvement\n-  If client is submitting to GRESB response check (due June 7 - need to confirm that date)\n-  Set timeline for when client will complete changes in Measurabl\n-  When client has completed changes, tell them to click 'Response check' again in MSR, this will signal to our team to map the answers to the GRESB portal and submit for response check in the GRESB portal.\n-  Let client know you are available to join the GRESB response check call to be there to help answer any quantitative and calculation questions. At the same time this is a good learning experience to be on the call with GRESB.\n-  Client may decide to work inclusively in the GRESB portal after their GRESB response check. If so, this is ok. Set expectation that it is now their responsibility to complete and file report.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Zuora billing integration,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h1. Introduction\n\nThis page is meant to give an overview of the integration between our system (MSR) and our subscription billing system (Zuora).\n\nh1. Purpose\n\nThe main purpose is to bill more accurately and more timely - allowing us to recognize revenue and (hopefully) increase cash flow.\n\nThe secondary purpose is to detect low utilization rates so Customer Success can identifier customers that may need some help leveraging our app.\n\nh1. Deliverables\n\nA *Billing Reconciliation Report* will originally be available in Metabase. In the future, the data may be exposed in the admin section of the MSR application.\n\nA sample subset of the data from a nightly report:\n\nThe *Acme Inc.* example demonstrates a customer that has under-paid for site usage and we need to charge them for it.\n\nThe *Zulu LLC* example demonstrates a customer that is under-utilizing what they have paid for. This is an opportunity for Customer Success to reach out.\n\nh1. Process\n\nh2. Manual\n\nThe manual part of the process involves mapping each paying MSR Group to a Zuora Subscription (see Terminology section for details). This will be done by the CFO and the Development department and may be delegated to Sales and Customer Success once functionality is built into our app.\n\nThe second manual part of the process is reviewing the reconciliation reports generated and following up on discrepancies and anomalies.\n\nh2. Automated\n\nOn an hourly basis, data from Zuora is synced with a database in our system. This gives us data about what products and services customers have paid for.\n\nOn a nightly basis, a billing stats job is run that collects data on usage in our system.\n\nWith both the pay and usage data, a nightly process runs a report to help reconcile pay vs. usage. The report data is stored in a table called {{zuora.billing_reconciliation_reports}} .\n\nh1. People\n\nThe main stakeholder for this integration is the CFO and Finance Department.\n\nA secondary stakeholder is Customer Success.\n\nThe departments responsible for the input of the correct data are Finance, Sales, and Customer Success.\n\nh1. Terminology\n\nDefining the terms related to this integration will help in reading and referencing this document.\n\nh2. MSR\n\nFrom MSR, we care about {{Groups}} , {{Sites}} , and {{Usync Accounts}}\n\n-  {{Group}} - Identified by an {{id}} normally referenced as an {{msr_id}} or a {{group_id}} . The human-recognizable field is called {{name}} .\n-  {{Site}} - This is a general name for a Manual Building (identified by {{building_id}}) and Estar Building (identified by the combination of {{msr_id}} and {{estar_id}}). The human-recognizable field is called {{name}} .\n-  {{Usync Accounts}} - These are split into 'Online' and 'Offline' and may be called {{Utility Sync}}, {{USync Online}}, and {{USync Offline}} . If it just says 'Utility Sync' assume it means 'Online'.\n\nh2. Zuora\n\nThere are a lot of entities and terms inside the Zuora system. For the purposes of this integration we will ignore most of them so we can focus on the most relevant ones.\n\n-  {{Subscription}} - This is by far the most important. It will be what we link to MSR Groups, Sites, and Usync Accounts.\n\n--  There are two identifiers - {{subscription_id}} and {{subscription_number}} . In most cases, we will use the {{subscription_number}} to identify the one that we want.\n--  The human-recognizable field is called {{invoice_owner_account_name}} .\n-  {{Product}} - This is what we will use to determine if a Subscription is for a Site, Utilty Sync Online, Utility Sync Offline, and any other product offerings that we end up integrating for billing.\n\n--  There are two identifiers - {{product_id}} and {{sku}} . In most cases, we will use the {{sku}} to identify the one we want.\n--  The human-recognizable fields are called: {{name}} , {{description}} , and {{category}} .\n\nh1. Mapping Zuora <-> MSR\n\nThe main link between the two systems is between {{Group}} and {{Subscription}}. This link will cover the vast majority of our customers. The {{Sites}} and {{USync Accounts}} will be linked indirectly through the {{Group}} that they belong to.\n\nSome of our customers have {{Sites}} and {{USync Accounts}} that need to be mapped to a {{Subscription}} that is different from the one that the {{Group}} is mapped to. In this case we will create a {{Site Subscription Override}} or a {{USync Account Subscription Override}} that will directly link to a {{Subscription}} and ignore the link between {{Group}} and {{Subscription}}.\n\nAn override will _always_ take priority over the Group-to-Subscription link.\n\nh1. Down and Dirty Data Details for Zuora\n\nA helpful Entity-Relationship Diagram is provided by Zuora [here|https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Business_Objects_Relationship].\n\nWhen digging into the details, there are more Zuora objects that we care about for this integration:\n\n-  {{Product}} - This tells us what 'Product' we are charging for (Site, Utility Sync Online, Platform, etc.)\n-  {{ProductRatePlan}} - This helps us link a {{RatePlan}} to a {{Product}}\n-  {{RatePlan}} - This helps us link a {{Subscription}} and a {{RatePlanCharge}} to a {{Product}}\n-  {{RatePlanCharge}} - This has both the quantity and the actual charge given a {{Subscription}} and a {{Product}}\n-  {{Subscription}} - This is our link into the MSR world. Usually linked to a {{Group}} but sometimes directly to another entity (e.g. {{Site}} )\n\nWe may, in the future, also care about:\n\n-  {{ProductRatePlanCharge}}\n-  {{Amendment}}\n\nh1. Down and Dirty Data Details for MSR\n\nThe relevant models in our database are diagramed in the file below:\n\nThe list of MSR groups used for this integration are heavily filtered. In order for a group to show up in the reconciliation report, the {{msr_id}} for the {{Group}} must be in the {{measurabl_stats.billing_ids}} table at the time the report is run.\n\nIn addition, the tables below are used on the MSR side to gather quantities for the products we care about:\n\n-  {{measurabl_stats.billing_estar_buildings}}\n-  {{measurabl_stats.billing_manual_buildings}}\n-  {{measurabl_stats.billing_sync_accounts}}\n\nIf more products need to be added to the reconciliation report, then more tables for calculating the numbers on the MSR side will need to be created and populated on a nightly basis.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

Suggested Outline and Guidance\n\n-  Background\n\n--  Short 1-2 sentence overview of the step the user is taking and why they are doing so\n--  Remember, we have about three seconds to capture the user’s attention and convince them that this article gives them what they need to know.\n--  By definition they have a problem right now and want a quick solution- if they can’t find it immediately they’ll create a ticket.\n--  This section should try to read their mind and speak to what they’re thinking at the moment they visit this article. It should also explain why this step is important.\n-  Thorough step-by-step guidance\n\n--  Spoonfeed the user every incremental step they need to move forward.\n--  [This article|https://portfoliomanager.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211028948-How-do-I-add-a-contact-] is a good example of that.\n--  Worry about being concise after you’ve made sure to capture every step the user needs to take, no matter how small. Remember, most users don’t know what we know, so don’t skip a step even if we think it’s obvious.\n-  Screenshots/video (if needed)\n\n--  We will most likely start with screenshots during this initial KB refresh and progress to video once we have this current round of content posted\n--  In adding screenshots of specific features/steps in the tool, make sure to zoom in to 150%-175%. I've found that 150% is the minimum needed to make sure an image looks acceptable in an article\n--  Where possible, take a wider screenshot that shows the entire screen the customer sees and then highlighting/outlining in red the things the user needs to click on for each step. This is not always practical given Zendesk’s formatting quirks and where key steps are positioned within the tool so be realistic here.\n--  Tools to create video content TBD, though we could start with [Zoom|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D617OXKhSYw], Camtasia, or another readily available, free (to us) tool\n\n#\n\nh1. General Tips and Tricks\n\n-  Keep articles focused on one specific task users are completing within the tool\n-  Keep terminology used across the articles consistent (Ie. Utility Sync, Utility Data Automation, ENERGY STAR, site manager, group manager, MSR, etc.)\n-  Define all acronyms on first mention, or avoid if possible (Marc does not like acronyms)\n-  Keeping the reading level and sentence complexity low (ie smart casual):\n\n--  When proofing, paste draft content into [www.hemingwayapp.com|http://www.hemingwayapp.com] and make appropriate edits\n--  Do the same with [www.app.grammarly.com|http://www.app.grammarly.com]\n-  Keep titles extremely short, ideally in the form of a question so that the wording the user sees matches the words that are going through their head\n\n#\n\nh1. Use this template and formatting\n\nBody font in KB articles on [www.support.measurabl.com|http://www.support.measurabl.com] should be Arial 16 (current articles are Arial 12). Use Arial 24 for header text (current articles use Arial 21). Do not bold headers (current headers are inconsistently bolded/not bolded). Only bold specific items where you’re drawing the user’s attention to a key step. The current articles use only slightly gray font (this color)). For now use that color, with the understanding that it may change when the new website goes live. You can copy font sizes and choices from here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DsscRG3MPTWITfCLEr5fjCiACtxek0OWuXB6oF3GvX4/edit#.\n\nh2. *Question the user has?*\n\nExample: I’m a group manager, how do I add a site manager?\n\nh2. *Answer:*\n\nh3.

page,Tips tricks for success in customer success,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h2. Add your clients on LinkedIn\n\nDon't be shy! Let them see what you're doing on LinkedIn. The benefit is that you can see what they're up to and refer back to them on any upcoming calls. Personally, I like to spend the first 20 minutes of my day scrolling through my LinkedIn newsfeed so I can be well versed on what my clients and their companies are up to.\n\nProbably should stay away from adding them on any other social media though. That is, unless you have a separate account for work.\n\nh2. Shed those extra words\n\nMost of us use extra unnecessary words in our every day speak and sometimes that translates to our emails too. If you can remove that word and the sentence still makes sense, take it out. Keeping it short and simple increases the likelihood of them reading the email carefully. Plus adding extra words has the unintended effect of making you sound less confident.\n\nRead it: [*5 Common Words That Make You Sound Less Confident in Emails*|https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-common-words-that-make-you-sound-less-confident-in-emails]\n\nh2. Spend the beginning 5-10 minutes of your meeting talking about them\n\nPeople, as a whole, are inherently self-absorbed. [*I didn't make this up*|https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-neuroscience-of-everybody-favorite-topic-themselves/]. Sounds badbut what it really means is that people love when other people ask them about themselves  so ask them how life is! If you don't know anything about them personally yet, you can start with 'what's been going on at work' or even offer up something about yourself.\n\nYou'd be amazed how far 'How was your weekend?' can go.\n\nh2. Respond to your client within 1 business day\n\nNot so much a tip or a trick, but actually a department rule. If you can't respond to your client within a business day, you probably have been distracted with 'other' tasks that can be delegated to other CS reps or interns. Talk to Courteney about your workload if this happens.\n\nThough the rule is to respond within 1 business day, it's best if you can get back to them within a couple of hours of response. This is especially difficult to maintain during reporting season, but by making email viewing the first priority of the day and then checking back every few hours, you'll be the most successful.\n\nh2. Celebrate your clients' big achievements\n\nYour clients are people too, they get married, have children, pay off student loan debt (must be nice), whatever! By asking them how they're life is going, you get a glimpse into this and it gives you a unique opportunity to be involved in the celebration too by sending them a 'Congrats' card or a Measurabl baby onesie or maybe even some beer as a consolation prize.\n\nI mean don't go crazy, we're a startup, but little things go along way.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Bulk historical billing projects via ardem,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h3. *Context*\n\nThe preferred means of processing PDF bills is through Measurabl's offline billing feature, however, sometimes the volume of bills necessitates a bulk approach for streamlined workflows on the client's end. Historical billing indicates that the bills being processed *date prior* to the start date of the client's contract, and are not included in the scope of that contract - since this is the case, an amendment to the contract must be made so loop in Nicole/Dana before starting any Next Steps.\n\nh3. Project Scoping\n\nThe following questions need to be answered and provided to Nicole/Dana to create a contract and have executed by client.\n\n-  How many bills?\n\n--  # of Accounts x # of Months = # of Bills\n--  Have the client fill out the Utility Sync bulk upload ss to retrieve the account numbers by site, this will also set you up for the future step of uploading offline accounts in bulk.\n-  When will the bills be compiled and delivered from client? (OK to answer after contract executed)\n\n--  This can take days for some and weeks for others, but is necessary to establish a timeline and and secure any USync/ARDEM/DEV resources needed. Timeline should be communicated to Nikk in order to flag upcoming delivery with ARDEM.\n\n###\n\nh3. Next Steps\n\n-  Client compiles bills.\n-  Communicate to client proper bill format and naming convention.\n\n--  Format: see part 2 'Offline Extraction' [here|https://app.tettra.co/teams/measurabl/pages/usync-pre-requisites-for-data-extraction].\n--  Naming convention: 'Vendor_Account#_BillDate'\n-  Indexing\n\n--  Client should catalog bills by account (i.e. If providing 10 Accounts w/ 10 Bills each, files should be organized into 10 folders based off account#, each folder containing the 10 bills for that unique account)\n--  Note: Accounts should also be catalogued by vendor if dealing with multiple vendors.\n-  CSM establishes bucket for bill transfer.\n-  In most cases, you can create a free box.com account and establish a folder that you can provide a shareable link and also add collaborators to. The free account allows for up 10.0 GB of space and a max file size of 250.0 MB which should suffice for most transfers.\n-  If the file transfer will be larger than 10.0 GB or require heightened security measures from the client above and beyond those of box.com, establishing an sFTP site is the next best option. See section 'Involving Dev' if this is the case.\n-  CSM uploads offline accounts.\n-  Use the Utility Sync bulk upload spreadsheet filled out by the client during the project scoping phase.\n-  Client transfers bills.\n-  Create a flow task for Nikk to deliver bills to ARDEM with a shareable link to the box.com account.\n-  If transferred through sFTP site, notify Lance.\n-  ARDEM processing and delivery.\n-  ARDEM processing timeline is dependent upon the volume of bills and other priority projects, but generally takes a week or two.\n-  Potential Roadblocks\n\n--  Unmapped Vendor\n\n--  See a list of all mapped vendors [here|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WL08wx1Ahp9Bqssi_9bRtTgWNmM8hTZfDcUGIC96oP4/edit#gid=1431086537]. Unmapped vendors will be returned from ARDEM but you can anticipate this by using the spreadsheet and coordinating the mappings with Nikk once you receive a copy of the PDF bills.\n--  Poor Image Quality\n\n--  If ARDEM is unable to clearly read the bills they will not be able to process them. Refer to step 1 for proper image quality.\n--  Unknown Accounts\n\n--  Unknown accounts will sit in Measurabl until an account is activated that matches. If you've completed step 3 this shouldn't be an issue, but there is a chance an unanticipated account will appear and you can investigate further in [app admin|https://app.measurabl.com/admin/utility-sync/unknown-accounts].\n-  QA\n-  It's proper practice to QA the bills once delivered and make sure all the data you expected to be there is there!\n\nh3. *Involving DEV*\n\nDEV should only only be involved in the process if the client wishes to use and sFTP site to transfer the bills; this can be a security requirement for some clients and we're happy to satisfy. However, DEV resources should be used sparingly and for that reason it's important to have the 'Project Scoping' and 'Next Steps' complete before reaching out to Lance for DEV support.\n\n*sFTP Site*\n\n-  An sFTP site is a secure site that can receive files. The DEV team will establish but needs from client:\n\n--  To generate an SSH Key and provide Measurabl the *public* key portion via email attachment (. DEV will then provision an sFTP and provide next steps to access.\n\n--  Note: CSM should communicate this to client. IT support may be required on client's end if they don't know how to create the key themselves but this is an extremely easy task.\n--  Notification that bills have been delivered. DEV will then (a) process directly to ARDEM or (b) put into an s3 bucket for CS to download and process (through UI or back through s3 in bulk). Option b would allow the opportunity to view bills from unmapped vendors and create a mapping.\n-  The above two steps are the ONLY aspects of the process for which DEV need be involved.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Historical data project,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""If your customer would like data in the Measurabl system looking backwards for more than two years, you will need to conduct a historical data project to collect and import all relevant data. Historical data collection is not easy because it's an archaeological dig, however it can be of significant value to the customer.\n\nh2. What is Historical Data?\n\n-  Utility and non-utility data that falls outside of the standard reporting time period defined with the customer (all data before TODAY is historical)\n\n--  Standard reporting history: previous 2 years\n--  Beyond that history: earlier than 2 years\n-  Allows customers to compare multiple years of performance data, set baselines, and maintain a single source of all ESG data\n-  Typical format is customer spreadsheets, but data could also come from another platform, PDF documents, or be completely lacking\n\nh2. What makes it so challenging?\n\n1) Customer Expectations\n\n-  Historical GHG emissions data can’t be added to Measurabl - we can only ingest raw data\n-  Data quality and analysis can be limited when based on historical data (Example: When customer gives one Electric Usage figure for an entire year, they won’t be able to compare one month to another with accuracy)\n-  We do not have the ability to interpret spreadsheet work done by another party and will need their confirmation/ understanding to properly use the data\n\n2) Disorganized Data\n\n-  Data in customer spreadsheets may be challenging to interpret and difficult to transfer into our upload template\n-  Mislabels that don’t match up with our standards\n-  It may be unclear how the data matches up to the site list in Measurabl\n\n3) Multiple Owners\n\n-  Data may be spread across multiple stakeholders - site managers, group managers, consultants\n-  More owners = more variability in the data received\n-  Responsibility often falls to CSM’s to organize the collection of data\n\n4) Incompatible Meters/Units\n\n-  Data needs to be in acceptable units for ingestion into ESTAR and Measurabl\n-  The acceptable units for ESTAR and Measurabl differ\n-  CSM’s should avoid conversion of figures as it leaves us in a dangerous position\n\nh2. Where do I start?\n\nAsk your customer where their historical data is located currently and what parameters are important for their goals.

page,Utility sync qa plan,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""The QA Plan for Utility Sync involves three key areas:\n\n-  Completeness Checks\n-  Accuracy Checks\n-  CPI(Continuous Process Improvement)\n\n*Completeness*\n\nAssuring the data is complete, is done through three checks:\n\n-  Calendar Year Data Check\n-  Gaps Monitoring\n-  Overlap Monitoring\n\nCalendar Year Data Check - To be built feature*\n\nOne key limitation with our current QA process is we do not measure a calendar year/rolling 12-24 months span gap count. For example if Meter # 123 has data from July'2017 to Dec'2017, we should be focussing on the gap from Jan 1st to July'2017 since almost all ESG reports need full data for the year. Having this feature will help Usync team focus on which meters do not have full 2017 or 2018 data and work on getting it complete. Our gaps logic does a good job of calling out a gap in between two statements, but does not measure retro-actively going back to the start of the year.\n\nAssembla Ticket : https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/feature-requests/tickets/498-meter-statusadd-column-forgaps-in-meter-over-last-24-months/details\n\nGaps Monitoring - MSR flags a gap whenever there is a missing invoice in between two statement spans. For example if there is an invoice in our system for Account #123 from 1/1/2018 to 1/31/2018 and an invoice from 3/1/2018 through 3/31/2018. Effectively this Account is missing the February'2018 data - 2/1/2018 through 2/28/2018. USync team regularly*(currently weighted by account volume) monitor these gaps and work with our extraction partners to fill the missing pieces.\n\nOverlap Monitoring - MSR flags an overlap whenever there are multiple invoices spanning the same statement period. For example Account # 123 has an invoice spanning 1/1/2018 through 1/31/2018 and another invoice spanning 1/26/2018 through 2/28/2018 - this causes an overlap for the span of 1/26/2018 through 1/31/2018 with more than 1 invoice reporting. The most common reason why this happens is utilities posting adjustment statements or billing erroneously. USync team regularly checks for these overlaps and attempts to resolve it internally by altering dates or deleting true-duplicates.\n\n*Accuracy Checks*\n\nThis is primarily done by anomaly detection. MSR's Data Science team has built out extensive data anomaly rules which flag errors, which in turn are validated by Usync team. If the error is a false positive(data is in tune with the utility bill) - the error is overridden. If the error is genuine, necessary steps are taken to fix it.\n\n*CPI(Continuous Process Improvements)*\n\nIt is imperative to continuously improve our QA processes to budget for new vendors that we onboard to our platform - specially with business expansion into EMEA, APAC etc.\n\nUSync's CPI is done through two ways:\n\n-  Internally\n-  Externally\n\nInternally - Examples of CPI internally include adding new anomaly rules, enhancing QA checks, building out new ways to ramp up QA efficiency etc. We also need to work on KPI's which are constantly tracked on a dashboard like metabase to drive improvements. - *Document on USync KPI's - In the works. More to come on this!*\n\nExternally - Examples of CPI externally involve working with our extraction vendors like Urjanet/Ardem to reduce the number of recurring data errors etc.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

Requirements\n\n##\n\nh2. What are we building?\n\n_Provide a one-sentence product description_\n\n##\n\nh2. Why are we building it?\n\n_Perhaps the most important part of this spec - the “why”. It’s important everyone on the team from the designer to the QA knows why were are doing what we are doing, and poking holes at this “why” is encouraged. There should be no doubt in this section when we finalize A&D. Add relevant links to research, discovery docs and artifacts_\n\n##\n\nh2. Who are we building this for?\n\n_Think: personas. We can illustrate this via user/job stories, as well_\n\n##\n\nh2. How will we measure success?\n\n_Add how we will determine whether the problem has being solved. This can be qualitative or quantitative_\n\n_e.g. if we’re trying to solve for accounts getting completely off paper utility bills, maybe success is measured through X # of accounts giving verbal sign of that their utility bills being completely done through Measurabl. Something more quantitative could be: 20% more daily active users on XYZ feature_\n\n##\n\nh2. What Customer Success needs are there?\n\n_Do we need a support article or new section of the help center? Is there any communication AMs should make to their clients via email, phone etc?_\n\n##\n\nh2. What Marketing needs are there?\n\n_Blog post? Press Release? Email campaign? What makes sense for this type of functionality we’re building?_\n\n##\n\nh2. What Sales needs are there?\n\n_Do we need a separate sales deck? Updates to our current deck? A training for salespeople to be able to sell and speak to this new feature or feature set?_\n\n#\n\n#\n\nh1. Scope\n\n##\n\nh2. V{{N}}\n\n_Once high level product design is figured out, add the releases, what is in scope and out of scope, and estimated dates for shipping. Add acceptance criteria to the releases where AC is known. For AC, think: what must the user be able to do in order for this spec to be signed off on? We could try “Given, when then” structure here:\n\n-  Given I am a Site Manager\n\n--  When I change my preferred units to kilowatts\n\n--  Then I see all of my energy metrics in kilowatts_\n\n###\n\nh3. Considerations\n\n-  Does the feature work any differently when used through App Admin?\n-  Does the feature work in subgroups? Differently? If it's not supported in subgroups, how is it presented or hidden?\n-  Does the feature work differently for site managers?\n-  Will users' preferences affect labels or how values are displayed, modified, or exported?\n-  Should the feature be included in imports or exports?\n\n--  Data Quality Report\n--  Site Snapshot PDF\n--  Group Snapshot PDF\n--  Bulk Sites\n--  Site Supplemental\n--  Word Export\n--  Table CSV and confirm what should be in the CSV export\n-  If the proposed UI includes tables…\n\n--  what kind of filter does each column use?\n--  how does each column sort?\n--  how does each column's content export?\n-  Will the feature be reflected in or affect rollups?\n\n--  Site Aspects\n--  Site Dashboard widgets\n--  Group Dashboard widgets\n--  GRESB Data Summaries\n--  CDP Data Summaries\n-  Will the UI need to respond for mobile?\n\n###\n\nh3. Affected Areas\n\nEach spec point should indicate which pages in the app will be affected by a change.\n\n###\n\nh3. Test Scenarios\n\nWe should create a simple Dev Test Group and basic scenario to illustrate the most basic functionality desired. We can point to the Test Group in this section and explain the basic functionality expected for each of the items in the Spec. It is up to QA to do edge testing and expand the scenarios, but this will ensure the basic functionality is available and has been tested.\n\n#\n\n#\n\nh1. Etc\n\n-  Stole the below from Intercom, they have a ‘notes’ section of their spec… I’m keeping here for inspiration and future iterations of this spec template. They call their specs “intermissions”  Notes\n-  ­Do not add the solution here.\n-  An intermission must always fit on a printed A4 page. If it does not, you haven’t a clear enough view of the problem yet. Keep working on it.\n-  ­Always have active and upcoming Intermissions printed in your team area or war room.\n-  ­Always use plain simple English, no technical terminology or codenames. Write this document as you would describe the problem to a colleague face to face.\n-  ­The PM owns the Intermission, but should always always solicit input from the full team\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Ardem activation,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h2. Steps for activation:\n\n-  Get the bills from client either via email or have them upload it to the Measurabl Business Box account. Please reach out to Dana for Box account access. Create a folder for the client if it does not exist and share the folder with the client.\n-  Let @Nikhil Krishna Godha know as soon as possible how many bills are to be processed and he'll send an email to ARDEM as a heads up. They need 4-5 days notice for batches over 2,000 bills at a time.\n-  While you're waiting for the bills, it's highly recommended that you gather the Provider Name, Account Number, and Site name associated with all the bills and activate the information in advance. If the client does not know the the account list, this will prolong the data processing. Here's how to activate the accounts:\n-  Share this file with @Nikhil Krishna Godha in #ardem so he can notify ARDEM and create activation templates for new providers. He'll let you know how many activations are needed.\n-  First thing's first, make sure that the accounts are not already activated as 'online'/Urjanet accounts. If so, you don't need to activate those accounts. The data will process automatically. For this step, download the list of accounts from the client's 'Accounts Delivered' page through Utility Sync and perform a vlookup between your list of accounts and what's already activated.\n-  Take the list of accounts that did not exist already in their Utility Sync account and go to the Imports & Exports page, click the 'Bulk Utility Sync Accounts' tile, click '[Download and fill out the template|https://app.measurabl.com/data/Measurabl_Utility_Account_Template.8014e9ec16.xlsx]' to download the bulk upload template.\n-  Now in Measurabl, go back to the Utility Sync page and look at the Real Estate page. In that table, see the column 'Sync ID', this will be the Site ID. Perform a vlookup between your list of accounts and the site they should be activated on and the list of Utility Sync sites. Use the 'Sync ID' to populate the Site ID in the template.\n-  In Measurabl, go to [this page|https://app.measurabl.com/admin/utility-sync/account-activation] and select the 'Known Providers' toggle. Download this list of known providers and do a vlookup between your list of providers to activate and what MSR's list of providers is. Enter the Provider Name and Provider Code into the template. If you don't find the provider in the list, ask @Nikhil Krishna Godha to tell you what code to use.\n-  Now enter your account number into the template and say 'TRUE' for Offline Account and tell us if it's a generation account or not. If you don't know, just say 'FALSE'. You can leave all the other columns blank.\n-  Upload this filled out template into the same 'Bulk Utility Sync Accounts' tile from step 3b. If you see an error (aka red text upon upload), the error should be obvious how to fix. If not, ask #customer-success to help.\n-  Once you get the bills, either download the folder from box.com or take the bills from your email and perform these steps to zip them (if you get stuck as Nikk to do this for you):\n-  Create a folder in your Downloads folder (name it something without spaces i.e. 'DCTFiles') and add all the PDFs to be proceed.\n-  Open Terminal or iTerm (all Macs have this)\n-  In Terminal, type {{cd ~/Downloads}} and then hit 'Enter' to run the command.\n-  Then type {{zip -r DCTFiles.zip DCTFiles}} (or whatever you named your folder in Step 4a) and then hit 'Enter' to run the command.\n-  Send the zip file to Jason via #ardem Slack channel and send him the Utility Sync sync ID the data belong's to. For the sync ID, go to Measurabl Admin > Utility Sync > Clients and grab the number in the first column after searching for the group in the third column.\n-  @Nikhil Krishna Godha will update the #ardem channel after he's notified ARDEM of the uploads and has gotten an ETA from them.\n\nh2. Nikk's steps:\n\n-  In step 2 above, notify Audrey about the # of bills\n-  In step 3a above, begin creating the activation templates for the providers that are new. If the CS rep doesn't have a list before the bills are processed, you should warn Audrey that you don't know what they'll find so she can bake that into the ETA.\n-  In step 3e above, if the provider doesn't exist in our list of supported providers, go to the Urjanet portal and in the drop down under your name select 'View providers' and search for aliases that contain the keywords from the provider name that the CS rep sent. If there's a pre-existing Urjanet code for this provider, send the CS rep that code. If there's not a pre-existing code make one up that looks like Urjanet would've made up the code (i.e. 'City of Santa Monica' would be 'CityOfSantaMonicaCA'). Add the new provider codes to the known_providers gsheet and let @Brianna Jackson know to update our list.\n-  In step 4 & 5 above, email Audrey that the bills have been uploaded and send her the new activations. Post in the #ardem channel when done with ETA.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

As of today, we are unable to support waste automation so if any waste bills are processed by Ardem then we have to download the waste files from here and manually upload it to Energy Star. Activate waste bills carefully. There's no notification when a file is uploaded to this bucket.\n-  {{measurabl-msr-prod-ardem}}> {{errors}} : where you can see a list of all of the bills that were not processed by Ardem because they were reminders or service fee bills instead of utility bills or if the bills were un-processable because they were too hard to read. The specific error is listed next to the bill UUID. There's no notification when a file is uploaded to this bucket.\n\nh2. Uploading bills for Ardem processing:\n\n-  Zip the files by running {{zip -r FolderWithBills.zip FolderWithBills}} in terminal\n-  Go here: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/measurabl-msr-prod-ardem/incoming-bills/\n-  Click into the appropriate sync_id folder\n-  Click the upload button (opens modal)\n-  Drag ZIP onto the modal\n-  Click “Upload”.\n\nh2.

Paid by landlord, Landlord adds in tenants. Tenants are asked to answer ~ 80 questions on their type of business, what sustainability initiatives they are doing in 8 categories ( energy, water, waste, procurement, leadership, etc.) All data is scored by category and type of initiative (measuring/monitor, policy, etc.). There is then a recommended action report that is generated with things in each category that you can do to improve.\n\nThe cool thing is you can see how you compare to:\n\n- other tenants in your building\n\n- other tenants based on your city, business type, size of space\n\nFrom the Landlord they can see and compare buildings, tenants, space types and export reports that show based on all of the responses where they can focus to improve.\n\nThe data is all qualitative, there is no input of energy consumption that I could tell.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

Why do we put data into ESTAR?\n\nThere are many use cases, and newer Reps should check in with others to check on their specific cases, but generally the reasons to put data into ESTAR are:\n\n-  The client wants to take advantage of the Utility Sync feature for the property\n-  The client already has an Energy Star account and wants to keep everything in one place\n-  Keeping property data in Energy Star helps the client maximize opportunities to receive scoring/credentials from Energy Star\n\nh2.

You can perform this task as the user or Measurabl.\n-  Set up an electric meter (if one is not already created) in the Energy Star site, and then share the entire site to this new contact. ([3.4.3 Set up Data Sharing|https://www.comed.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/WaysToSave/LearnMore/euds_buildingmanager_guide.pdf])\n-  Pull up the EUDS website and click on the 'Create Report' icon to see the list of sites. Then click on a site ID to see more information. In this view, you'll see the building manager id and the building id. You'll need both to share the meter to ComEd. ([3.4.3 Set up Data Sharing|https://www.comed.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/WaysToSave/LearnMore/euds_buildingmanager_guide.pdf])\n-  Share the site as a Data Exchange where they receive Read Only access to the profile and No access to anything else besides the meter you want updated, for which they should receive Full Access. Enter the building manager id and building id here. ([3.4.3 Set up Data Sharing|https://www.comed.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/WaysToSave/LearnMore/euds_buildingmanager_guide.pdf])\n-  After sharing the site, almost instantly (though they say wait 30 minutes), you'll see the 'Connect to Energy Star' box have a red box with an 'x' in it. That means it's connected. ([3.4.3 Set up Data Sharing|https://www.comed.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/WaysToSave/LearnMore/euds_buildingmanager_guide.pdf])\n-  Make sure you have set up recurring monthly deliveries to both be auto confirmed and auto submitted to Energy Star.

For example, if I want February 2018 data, I will schedule the delivery for April 15, 2018 because billing dates tend to be 10-15 days after the last day of data. All bills must be in before we can get an aggregate number.\n\nNotes:\n\n-  I've noticed that you cannot set up more than one meter to a ComEd EUDS building manager id and/or ESTAR building.

In order to harness more data, we will be using the Tags and Check-Boxes forms (left-hand side of open tickets).\n\n*Checkboxes*\\\nNow, when working to resolve a ticket, you can select any of the four checkboxes to classify a ticket: Utility Sync, Energy Star, Manual Data, and User Account. Each checkbox also has automatically generated tags associated with them. The following gives examples of when to utilize which checkbox:\n\n-*Utility Sync:* Use this checkbox when the ticket is regarding anything U-Sync related. For example, a user sending us PDF bills to upload through Ardem, adding a new utility provider, Utility Sync issues, questions, discrepancies in the data that we need to fix with Urjanet, etc.\n\n- *Energy Star:* Check this box when the user is asking any ESTAR questions, manual entry through ESTAR, Property Sharing with Measurabl from ESTAR, meter sharing issues, ESTAR credential failure, etc.\n\n*-Manual Data:* Check this when the user is asking a question about manual meter data entry, how to upload, bulk upload xls's, etc.\n\n-*User Account:* Check this box when the ZD ticket is regarding a Measurabl User Account issue. For example, being added to a site or group, forgot password, Hubspot token link, user profile settings (currency/unit preferences, etc.).\n\n*Tags*\n\nWe will be using tags moving forward as much as possible in order to identify which other types of tickets we receive in Zendesk from users. For example, add the proper tags for the other inquiries that are not regarding the Checkbox options.\n\n*_Examples include:_* project/audit uploads, certifications/ratings, trends page, data quality alerts, reports (we will likely add a checkbox for this during reporting season), subgroups, site details (floorspace, occupancy, GAV, controls, Lifecycle Events, Ordinances).

page,Whitelisting and why,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h2. What is 'whitelisting':\n\nWhen we provide specific access to an Energy Star user to add readings to Measurabl meters. Typically, any readings added to Measurabl meters outside of Utility Sync are deleted eery 8 hours through the Synchronizer.\n\nh2. Why is it necessary:\n\nThere are some instances where we're unable to get data from Urjanet/Ardem fast enough for a gap or a late meter and in order to meet a deadline for a certification or compliance filing, we'll quickly upload a gap filler to get them ready for submission. Another common scenario is when there's no bill online nor do they have one in their files for processing but somehow have the consumption and cost values. In these instances we sometimes make the decision to bulk upload manual readings so they can see a quick turnaround.\n\nIn reality it shouldn't be necessary, Urjanet should be able to rush the data for us on request and/or the client should be able to provide us the bill if it's real non-estimated data. However, in most real life scenarios, the clients see gaps and want to get rid of them by filling them with 0s or estimations because they're on a tight deadline. This is why we typically prevent users from touching Measurabl meters.\n\nBefore proceeding, check with CS Leadership to make sure this is a process you should be doing. Chances are they will say to push back or that the product should be doing something to solve.\n\nh2. How to bulk upload gap fillers:\n\n***CHECK WITH CS LEADERSHIP BEFORE PERFORMING THIS TASK, THIS SHOULD BE USED SPARINGLY\n\n-  Check if the group you want to upload data for already has DATAIMPORT whitelisted (-106)\n-  Skip to step 3 if it is. Otherwise, go to the #utility-sync channel and request that Lance add -106 to the Utility Sync account desired. The Utility Sync id is the first column in the Admin > Utility Sync > Clients table.\n-  Login to Energy Star and click the 'Upload and/or update multiple properties' link on the left hand side (second link in the box on the left)\n-  Click 'Create an Upload Template'\n-  Select the 'Add Bills to Meters' option in phase 1, then for phase 2 select One Property and the property desired. Note: if you're uploading data for multiple sites, select Multiple Sites instead and select all the sites desired\n-  All the meter types that are available for that site/those sites will appear at the bottom for phase 3. Select the meter type(s) associated with the meter(s) you want to update and then enter the max number of readings you expect to upload for each meter.\n-  Click Create & Download template. This will generate a template of meters for you to update with the readings you want to upload. Fill it out, make sure you don't leave any formulas in the upload and that you used Paste Values only to preserve any proper formatting used (Energy Star is sensitive)\n-  Then in the 'Upload Spreadsheets' box, select Type of Upload = Add bills to meters and click 'Choose File' to select the file. Then click 'Upload'.\n-  If it fails, click the errors to find out why. If you're having trouble figuring out the issues, post in #customer-success for help. If it succeeds, then you'll see those readings in the meters desired as authored by DATAIMPORT.\n\n{{PROD [msr]> select g.id group_id,g.name,sa.sync_account_id,sa.estar_account_id,w.estar_account_id wl_estar_account_id from msr.sync_estar_account_whitelist w, msr.sync_accounts sa, railmodel.groups g where g.id=sa.msr_id and sa.sync_account_id = w.sync_account_id;}}\n\n{{+----------+---------------------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+}}\n\n{{| group_id | name                            | sync_account_id | estar_account_id | wl_estar_account_id |}}\n\n{{+----------+---------------------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+}}\n\n{{|      173 | Lion Industrial Trust           |               3 |           106564 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|      173 | Lion Industrial Trust           |               3 |           106564 |              110984 |}}\n\n{{|       29 | Lion Properties Fund            |               4 |           106566 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|       29 | Lion Properties Fund            |               4 |           106566 |              110984 |}}\n\n{{|      140 | USAA Realco                     |              13 |            13194 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|      140 | USAA Realco                     |              13 |            13194 |              110984 |}}\n\n{{|    10126 | NAT Advisors                    |              24 |           116157 |              116157 |}}\n\n{{|    10126 | NAT Advisors                    |              24 |           116157 |              116267 |}}\n\n{{|    10006 | CBRE GI Fund 6                  |              28 |           118066 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10383 | Optoro                          |              46 |           119891 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10606 | Taubman                         |              71 |            98358 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10716 | Monday Properties               |              80 |            39207 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10716 | Monday Properties               |              80 |            39207 |               39207 |}}\n\n{{|    10716 | Monday Properties               |              80 |            39207 |              110984 |}}\n\n{{|    10759 | Akridge                         |              89 |            69155 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10222 | Shorenstein Properties, LLC     |             113 |            26292 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10316 | CIM Fund VI                     |             126 |           135513 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10313 | CIM Fund III                    |             127 |           135512 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10315 | CIM Fund IV                     |             128 |           135525 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    10311 | CIM                             |             129 |            56562 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    11476 | Alexandria Real Estate Equities |             146 |           140992 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    11476 | Alexandria Real Estate Equities |             146 |           140992 |              140992 |}}\n\n{{|    11365 | CBREGI-SP Fund 8                |             166 |           152882 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    12876 | TA Realty                       |             169 |           152443 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    12799 | J Street Companies              |             179 |            31340 |                -106 |}}\n\n{{|    13244 | Tishman                         |             187 |            21200 |               21200 |}}\n\n{{|    11158 | DCT Industrial                  |             196 |           206127 |              206127 |}}\n\n{{|    14303 | Lerner                          |             207 |            15938 |               15938 |}}\n\n{{+----------+---------------------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+}}\n\n{{28 rows in set (0.00 sec)}}\n\nh2. FAQ:\n\n*Q:* Does it matter if I login as Measurabl or the client in Energy Star?\n\n*A:* No, they both just need access to the meter in question\n\n*Q:* Can I use the bulk upload that's available on the meter's page in Energy Star?\n\n*A:* No, that will attempt to upload the readings as whoever you're logged in as. Unless that user is whitelisted, the readings will get deleted.\n\n*Q:* What if the meter is inactive, does that matter?\n\n*A:* You shouldn't be uploading readings after the inactivation datethat's weird and clearly fake news. If there's genuine data after the inactivation date then the meter shouldn't be inactive (?????). Inactive meters don't show up in the template that Energy Star generates, so if you're attempting to fill a gap (before the inactivation date), you will need to remove the inactivation date first before performing step 6 above.\n\nQ: How does removing meters from 'Metrics' on Energy Star work with Whitelisting?\n\nA: With or without whitelisting - all MSR Meters will always be on the Metrics page on Energy Star. Our Syncronizer job that runs every night will put any MSR meters that were pushed into 'Out of Metrics' back in to the 'Metrics' bucket. This scenario is usually applicable for clients who want to remove 1 out of many meters on an account. The solution is to either de-activate the full account(since Urjanet enrolls Accounts and not meters) or work with the vendor to de-couple that meter into its own account.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"
page,Faq single sign on sso,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h1. Terminology\n\nh3. Q: What is SSO?\n\nSSO stands for Single Sign-On. It is a session and user authentication service that permits a user to use one set of login credentials to access multiple applications. It is very similar to how you can use your driver's license ID card to board a plan or get access to a bar.\n\nh3. Q: What are the benefits of SSO? Why does someone want SSO?\n\nFrom a user perspective, that user can use a single username and password for multiple services. At Measurabl we are able to use our GSuites username and password to login to multiple services such as Gmail, Assembla, Metabase, or Sentry.\n\nFrom a company perspective, companies can now more easily enforce security rules such as network location access, password length/strength/rotation restrictions. Companies can also use SSO to easily prevent access to multiple applications.\n\nh3. Q: What is LDAP or Active Directory?\n\nSSO is often used in conjunction with a directory service. Common protocols include Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). These services are responsible for defining a user and roles or access abilities. In the driver's license analogy, these services would be the DMV creating the access card and defining the license classification.\n\nOften times, people refer to 'Active Directory'. This is the Microsoft implementation of LDAP.\n\nh3. Q: What is SP vs IdP?\n\nSP stands for 'service provider'.\n\nIdP stands for 'identity provider'.\n\nThe service provider verifies the user information against the identity provider. In most cases, the client will provide the identity provider and Measurabl will be the service provider.\n\nh3. Q: What is SP-initiated vs IdP-initiated SSO?\n\nSP-initiated SSO is the single sign-on protocol initiated by the service provider. An SP initiated SSO is very similar to what you would see on medium.com where the user visits an application and can choose from a list of identity providers.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88721/O7zuwLWPrRkQQG6HJBtUtvxJWq2cdlD38Ft18Roh.png|alt=O7zuwLWPrRkQQG6HJBtUtvxJWq2cdlD38Ft18Roh.png!IdP-initiated SSO is the opposite. This is the SSO protocol originating from the identity provider. Using the example of medium.com, if it were an IdP-initiated login (say for example Google), the user would visit a URL such as google.com/sso/medium.com. The user would then be prompted for her credentials. Upon validation, she would be forwarded to medium.com and logged in automagically.\n\nh3. Q: What is SAML?\n\nSAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. It is the open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization packets between the service provider and identity provider. SAML 2.0 became the standard protocol circa 2005.\n\nh1. How does it work?\n\nh3. Q: Can a company enforce its users to use SSO?\n\nWe can only force users to use SSO by domain name. For example, if Microsoft wanted to enforce SSO, all users that have a '@microsoft.com' email would be forced to use SSO. Users that wander onto Measurabl and attempt to create a user with their '@microsoft.com' email will not be able to that.\n\nh3. Q: Can a company manage users through LDAP?\n\nNo. Users must be created within Measurabl and can then use SSO to login to Measurabl. You can say that Measurabl SSO purely handles 'authentication' and not 'identification'.\n\nh3. Q: What SSO pathways does Measurabl support?\n\nMeasurabl supports SAML 2.0 and IdP-initiated SSO.\n\nh1. Integration\n\nh3. Q: How easy is it to incorporate SSO?\n\nThis depends. Measurabl supports a subset of SSO, mainly the SAML 2.0 protocol. We currently do not support the Open ID Connect protocol. Even if the client does support SAML 2.0, there can be hiccups in the metadata exchange process which can be a long and arduous process to gather the correct resources and debug.\n\nh3. Q: How long does the process take?\n\nFrom start to finish this process can take several weeks. This is highly dependent on correctness of data from both sides and the ability to reach and coordinate the correct resources to debug.\n\nThe shortest implementation to date has been about two days worth of work. The longest implementation has taken weeks.\n\nh3. Q: What data do I need from the client?\n\nIn order to setup the integration, Measurabl will require what is typically called the metadata.xml file. This file will, at least, contain an entity ID, SSO target URL and an X509 certificate. It will usually have more information about the implementation. These are typically delivered in XML format either as an email attachment or URL. Measurabl typically asks for a test or staging metadata file to test against the Measurabl staging environment.\n\nh3. Q: What data does Measurabl need to supply to the client?\n\nMeasurabl is responsible for providing an XML file with Measurabl's SSO capabilities and X509 certificate. Each client receives their own certificate which is set to expire at the end of the year and will be rotated annually.\n\nh3. Q: What does the process look like after the development team steps in?\n\n-  Both teams create X509 certificates typically for both a user acceptance test (UAT, a.k.a staging) and production environment.\n-  These certificates are combined as part of the metadata.xml and exchanged. (This data does not pose any risk and can be sent via email.)\n-  Both the client and Measurabl load the metadata file into each respective environment.\n-  Measurabl creates a unique UAT password for the client. (This is so we don't have to share the Measurabl http auth password)\n-  The client can then test the staging platform with a URL provided by the client. The user should not be visiting the Measurabl app URL (staging.measurabl.com) directly.\n-  If the user is not able to login, we can see the SSO login attempt in slack #log-monitor-dev, we will dig into the logs to debug and coordinate with the client if changes need to be made\n-  When the user is able to login successfully, we can coordinate with the client timing of the production environment deploy. This currently needs to happen outside of business hours\n\nOn a yearly basis, we will have to rotate our X509 certificates. This is done annually near the end of the year. We will co-term expirations of new certificates such that all client certificates will expire at the same time.\n\nh2. #\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"
page,Utility sync strategy nikks recommendations,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""*Summary of recommendations:*\n\n• *On-boarding Efficiency* - Currently the process is very inefficient with multiple programmable steps such as loading batches, validating credentials, uploading to Urjanet's portal and responding to Account statuses such as credential failure, Account not found etc. We should look at means of automating as much of this process as we can through API integration to Urjanet and integrating Account Status back to our tool eliminating as much human intervention as we can - the end result : Much faster on-boarding of accounts & improved user-experience!\n\n• *Usync Portal* - We need to untether from EStar and have a tool in house which stages incoming data from Ardem, Urjanet and other vendors. We need to QA the data thoroughly and then sync to Estar or any other tool out there. This Portal should also allow users to add manual readings after which our system should take over and throw audits at the data to weed out as much noise and ingest it into our system. This portal should have a comprehensive dashboard to display account health - % data collected, % sites with complete data and KPI's on Data health in general. This will be a massive boost for our quest to be pro-active and not reactive. We can't improve what we can't measure! End-Result : Happy clients thanks to quality and complete data from MSR!\n\n• *QA Program* - As a sustainability-data company - it is imperative that we have a rock solid QA program and have all sorts of KPI's - most importantly the Error Rate. This is the #1 KPI that data companies are measured on and we should constantly challenge ourselves to out-do our previous best to set the tone for rest of the industry.\n\nIn order to have a well-rounded QA program, these 7 characteristics are key:\n\n· Accuracy – We need to build in more audits before and after we store data – to ensure we hit 95% accuracy\n\n· Legitimacy – We need to work with our data suppliers to ensure (through business rule requirements) they are pulling data only from the right portal – exceptions to be limited to <= 3%\n\n· Consistency – We need to work with our data vendors to get assurance on consistency with data acquisition – exceptions to be limited to <= 3%\n\n· Timeliness – We need to strive for faster turn-arounds on data delivery to our clients – goal - <= 5 Business days – to include 12 months of history\n\n· Comprehensiveness – We need to diversify our data supplier portfolio and build in-house templates to keep the manual data entry down to 0.5% or lower\n\n· Accessibility -\n\n· Granularity – We need to ensure our data is correct at its most granular level – down to the Unit of Measure, date format, currency format etc. Errors <=3%\n\n*KPI’s*\n\nCritical KPI’s to measure the efficiency of this supply chain:\n\n· Cost Efficiency – (net expense of all acquisition methods) : (incoming revenue)\n\n· Manual Effort - % time involved by USync team to correct data\n\n· Data Accuracy - % of Errors by each acquisition method\n\n· Operational Time Spent - % Time by USync time on each acquisition method\n\n· Delivery Metrics – % Data delivered within ‘x’ number of days\n\n· Out of scope work - % time USync team spends on vendors not covered by any of the above data acquisition options\n\n*• Internal Training*\n\nIt is key to have bi-annual training workshops for CS, USync & Product teams to get together and have a 'Learn-Unlearn-Relearn' session - Learning how everyone/clients feel about Usync(feedback), Un-learning old practices and Relearn the process this time by inculcating the latest & greatest best-practices.\n\n*SWOT*\n\n*Strengths*:\n\n· Solid & very intuitive product – ease of use\n\n· Manned by team with 15+ years of combined Utility Data Experience\n\n· Usync is extremely helpful to the end users\n\n*Weaknesses*:\n\n· Several manually intensive pieces which need to be ironed out for operational efficiency\n\n· Data is being synced to Estar without any QA checks - which will hurt us for international accounts\n\n· Lack of long term support for edge case utility vendors\n\n· Limited Dev. Resources dedicated to USync\n\n*Opportunities*:\n\n· Mobile apps? – for folks who want to view reports/account status in real time on the fly\n\n· Diversifying our data vendor portfolio is critical to our continued long-term success\n\n· Give our clients more tools to input the data – which can then be reviewed and accepted by Usync team – for gaps etc.\n\n· In-house ticketing system – which can interface with our product and also our vendors\n\n· Need to brainstorm the future of utility-data acquisition – direct API bridges with utility vendors, real-time credential validation etc. – to stay ahead of the curve\n\n· Interval data product?\n\n· Annual user conference? – great opportunity for Sales/Marketing & Treating our clients.\n\n· Hiring key talent from across the industry – to further strengthen the team\n\n*Threats*:\n\n· Data-vendor fragility – need to build in insurance by diversifying options & absorbing some work in-house\n\nTo establish, nurture and maintain a reliable supply chain for acquiring utility data to fuel USync so that our clients can continue to use our product for their sustainability reporting needs. This supply chain of utility data can be a combination of:\n\n· A) Vendors who specialize in Utility Data Acquisition(Online) – Urjanet, WattzOn etc.\n\n· B) Vendors who specialize in OCR Processing – Ardem,WattzOn\n\n· C) Self-pull (internal web scrapers)\n\n· D) API Integrations for critical/high-volume vendors\n\n· Need to budget some time periodically to gather market intelligence on what our competitors are doing/announcing and who could be our next competitor? How do we compare against the big dogs in this space like Schneider? How can we give them a run for their money?\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

You will have to use the bulk upload\n-  This is going to create 2 instances for the same account, so head to the Meter Status page and then merge the 2 meters together so that only Teco is left.\n\nh2. *Unshared Meters:*\n\nTimeline: Check if badge number increase once a day\n\nAssigned: Nikk\n\nSteps:\n\n-  If badge number increases, identify which is the new meter in the list. Identify if account number should be deactivated or if meter needs to be reshared\n\nh2. *Account Activation:*\n\nTimeline: MWF\n\nAssigned: Nikk\n\nSteps:\n\n-  Click[ here|https://app.measurabl.com/admin/utility-sync/account-activation] to see the pending USync changes\n-  Any items that are highlighted in red mean that the PM added a new provider that we didn't have in our list. Typically, the client has used a different phrase than the one we have. Please check if we have a similar phrase in the 'Known Providers' toggle (i.e. they enter 'City of San Jose' but we have 'San Jose Water') and if we do delete the old provider and recreate it with the known provider. If not, skip this step.\n-  Check if any of the pending changes are associated with Customer Issues by filtering the last column to any issue other than 'Blank' (uncheck 'Blank'). If there is something pending, check the new information and resolve if issue is fixed. Otherwise, let CS reps know that PM still needs to resolve and they will reach out via support.\n-  Then click 'Generate Batch'. If an alert pops up talking about historical start dates and building IDs, then we have to set historical start dates for some properties. Copy one of the building IDs and search for it in the table below to figure out which property needs a historical start date. Click on the property then 'Historical Date'. Use the existing data in Energy Star to help you determine what this date should be. For example, if they are activating energy + water and the energy data is updated through 12/31/2015 but the water data is updated through 1/1/2015, then say 'yes' to historical and make your historical start date the older one (1/1/2015). If the buildings up to date within 1-3 months of today, say 'no' to historical and set the start date using the same methodology as before.\n-  Once done with all historical start dates, refresh and click 'Generate Batch' and it'll send you to a page where you can download the generated batch. Download the one you just generated, rename the file to have 'Measurabl-' at the beginning and save as .xls. Go to the[ Urjanet portal|http://portal.urjanet.net/] > Enroll > Upload New Activation Form to upload the file.

Delivery File Failures (stripping out 'bad' readings):\n\nTimeline: As the error appears in #urjanet or #ardem-alerts\n\nAssigned: Nikk\n\nBackground: Typically file failures are reviewed by DEV guys quickly after the error happens. If they confirm that there's one or more readings causing the whole file to fail, we may want to just pull out the 'bad' readings so we can get the 'good' data processed. [See example #7628|https://app.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/tickets/7628] where a delivery came for a meter type we aren't familiar with.\n\nSteps:\n\n-  Go to the failed [Urjanet|https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/measurabl-msr-prod-drop/urjanet/failed/?region=us-west-2&tab=overview] or [Ardem|https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/measurabl-msr-prod-drop/ardem/failed/?region=us-west-2&tab=overview] bucket in S3 depending on if the error came from #ardem-alerts or #urjanet\n-  Locate the failed file (use the search bar) and click on it. Then click on the Download button.\n-  Open the file in Sublime Text (not excel) and *delete* the 'bad' readings, aka the rows with the bad data. In the example above, that's all readings of type 'district_heat'.\n-  'Save As' the file as the same name but with a short note at the end of the file name, i.e. 'Measurabl_04_19_18_15_00_nodistrictheat.csv' in example above.\n-  In S3, go to the [measurabl-msr-prod-urjanet|https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/#] or [measurabl-msr-prod-ardem/incoming|https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/measurabl-msr-prod-ardem/incoming/?region=us-west-2&tab=overview] (same source as the failed file) folders and upload the new file you just edited.\n-  You'll receive a notification in slack either way if it failed or succeeded.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Baseline account set up for limited e billing customers,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h2. Customer Description\n\nCustomer wants to maximize Usync for their portfolio, however they are hesitant to shut off their paper bills and have some providers without online portals. They would like to delegate to Site Managers. (Urjanet and Ardem for everything)\n\nWhy might e-billing options be limited?\n\n-  Customer Accounts Payable could be in charge of billing, meaning they call the shots to pay bills on time\n-  Turning on E-billing sometimes turns off paper billing\n-  Online portal from the provider might not have PDF bills (Unsupported Provider)\n\nh2. Important Notes for Setting Expectations\n\n1) Multiple roads could be the right choice for them to reach their destination: You should think about their Usync set-up as a hybrid where you optimize for online options wherever possible and lay the groundwork for invoice collection or excel data collection where it is absolutely necessary.\n\n2) Keep things focused: Take the process one step at a time with a customer rather than overwhelming them with different possibilities up front - this helps them stay calm and minimizes the potential for unnecessary work-arounds.\n\n3) Timeline delays: A hybrid USync portfolio can mean varied timelines to receive complete data. Typically it takes 3-4 weeks from receipt of customer information to the delivery of that data. If it's an unknown provider, the process can take 6-12 weeks because brand-new templates must be built out in the back-end. On week 4 there's a potential for errors to get flagged that require customer intervention (Unsupported Provider, Account set-up, Username/Password failure, etc.)\n\n4) Usync Offline Bill Upload: Their site managers will probably use this feature often, so it's important that they are trained on it early.\n\n5) Prioritize best practices: Always emphasize for customers that we have a strong preference and highly recommend sticking to the following order (they can always move more accounts online over time if they're able to make internal changes that improve viability) -\n\na) Online accounts\n\nb) PDF bill scans\n\nc) Manual data through spreadsheet\n\n6) Requirements for success: Online E-billing accounts will only work when the provider website contains a copy of the bill on the website, and the bill clearly indicates cost and usage for the month (along with currency and UOM). PDF scans must be clear to read, 1 month's invoice per file, include a unique account number, and the bill clearly indicates cost and usage for the month (along with currency and UOM). Spreadsheets must be in standard format. See [article on pre-requisites for data extraction |https://app.tettra.co/teams/measurabl/pages/usync-pre-requisites-for-data-extractionhttps://app.tettra.co/teams/measurabl/pages/usync-pre-requisites-for-data-extraction]for more details.\n\n7) Unsupported Providers: Nikk maintains a list of [online providers that we can't support|https://app.tettra.co/teams/measurabl/pages/urjanet-unsupported-online-portals#] because: No bills are available on the site, it's a bill-management tool and not a real provider, it's a waste provider, or the invoice comes from a landlord.

USGBC GBIGQuarterly check\n\nMeasurabl automatically checks all buildings in the system against the list of certifications available on the USGBC GBIG website. We do this via an API.

Any new certs to add should match with a cert that is already approved in our system. There shouldn't be any certs to add that aren't already existing; eg LEED 2019 D&C would match to LEED D&C. Note that BREEAM is intentionally ignored in USGBC because we get those directly from BREEAM instead. Note that LEED without an ending like D&C or other ending that matches the approved LEED types should be ignored (eg LEED-HOMES MR v2010 ignore because it's an MR cert that doesn't count).\n\nh3. BREEAM\n\nMeasurabl also has an integration with BREEAM. Those certification types don't change, so we don't have to review them the way we do with USGBC.\n\nh2.

For example, if the client was paying a monthly rate of $3,000 (36,000 ARR) on day 1 of the Initial Access Term and on day 365), they pay $5,000 (60,000 ARR) then the total deal value is $*24,000*. To the extent that other upsells have occurred throughout the year that have been captured as separate deals in Hubspot, these need to be subtracted from the Organic Growth - Previous Year value, so they aren't double counted.\n\n-  For the ARR dollar value for day 1 of the Initial Access Term, reference the mutually executed contract in Gdrive.\n-  For the ARR dollar value for day 365, use the, Revenue Detail spreadsheet to look up the monthly rate .\n-  Other upsells would appear as previous year deals in Hubspot.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

See examples in Score Debrief Template.\n-  _Room for Improvement_\n\n--  Focus on quantitative gaps that Measurabl can help improve upon - completing the 'Aspects - Gaps' tab can inform more focused points. This is also a chance to discuss expansion/upsell opportunities that would benefit the client. See examples in Score Debrief Template.\n\n*Aspects - Gaps*\n\n-  Create a row for each question with missed points (gap).\n\n--  Using the scorecard, start from the first aspect and move linearly through the rest of the report.\n--  Each row should have columns A-G filled out.\n-  Columns H, I, J should only be filled in for gaps in *_quantitative_* questions that Measurabl can provide valid feedback on. See list at end of document for quantitative questions.\n\n--  (H) Notes\n\n--  Using the[ GRESB guidance|http://gresb-public.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/Assessments-and-Reference-Guides/2018-GRESB-RE-Reference-Guide.pdf], make an educated inference as to why points were missed.

Prior to your call, review the table below and see if there are any potential up-sell opportunities. Work with the sales team to generate a quote and present this during the Score Debrief call.\n\nIf your client experienced any of the following there is an opportunity for up-sell:\n\nh1. Green Star\n\nThe Green Star is a rating on absolute performance (as opposed to the rating, which is relative)\n\n*What does it mean if my customer earned a Green Star?*\n\nEntities with scores higher than 50 on both the Implementation & Measurement and the Management & Policy dimensions are rated a “Green Star” and can communicate their position as such.\n\n*How are the number of stars determined?*\n\nStars are assigned based on the quintile where the entity is placed. People in the top quintile (top 20%) earn 5 stars, people in the bottom quintile earn 1 star. This rating is calculated relative to the global performance of reporting entities, so it shows you exactly where they stand on a global scale.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

The entire recording is an hour and 14 minutes long and does not have a visual, just audio.\n\nAll submissions must be done before June 8, 2018.\n\nh2. Background:\n\nGRESB responders that are GRESB members receive one free Response Check from GRESB themselves. To submit to GRESB, the client must get the survey to 100% completion in the GRESB portal and then we can click 'Submit for Response Check' in the GRESB portal. Non-members can also request this but they will be forced to pay for it. An email is sent to the client to book the meeting and the CS rep should also be on that call to answer questions and take notes. Typically, we suggest doing a Measurabl Response Check before a GRESB Response Check so we can find smaller & easier problems first.\n\nh2. Steps for Submittal:\n\n-  The client submits the survey in Measurabl for Response Check which will lock the survey for them and provide an export of the survey in a Flow task & Slack channel\n-  The exported survey is saved off in the client's GDrive folder with the date of export and then the answers are mapped to the GRESB portal\n-  Once the survey has reached 100% completion in the GRESB portal, a 'Review & Submit' section will appear at the bottom left of the page. Click it.\n-  A list of alerts will appear if there's an outlier or unanswered question preventing submission. You will need to correct those before continuing. If you need help with an explanation for an outlier, reach out on Slack to the #customer-success channel.\n-  Submit the survey for Response Check. *MAKE SURE YOU'RE CLICKING THE SUBMISSION FOR RESPONSE CHECK NOT FULL SUBMISSION*. It's obvious because the button says Response Check. If you don't see a Response Check Submission button and there's no errors preventing submission, it could be because it's after June 8, which is the last day they accept submissions.\n-  Send an email to your client informing them it has been submitted and then ask them to invite you to the meeting when it's been booked.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"
page,3rd party assurance verification,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h2. Definitions of Assurance and Verification\n\nBoth are ways of checking data! Customers submitting to GRESB receive incrementally more points of data checks, then verification, then assurance. You can read more [here|https://www.measurabl.com/blog/how-assurance-and-verification-help-your-sustainability-efforts/] and [here|https://www.measurabl.com/blog/alignment-assurance-and-verification/].\n\n*Assurance:* Confirms that reports are held to the same standard as financial data, which has stricter standards than non-financial data and must be performed by an accredited third party auditor (such as pWc, LRQA, or Deloitte). Reports with assurance will have all calculations, data collection and analysis processes, and data quality checked.\n\n*Verification:* can only be provided for non-financial data (since there is no “standard”) and does not need to be performed by an accredited professional. When reports are verified, the data itself has been checked, but often the calculations and analyses made on the reports have not undergone the same accuracy assessment.\n\nh2. Setting Customer Expectations\n\n-  If they're interested in assurance/verification, initial conversations with 3rd party should begin by March\n-  Measurabl has 2 highly-recommended partners (ISOS and LRQA) who conduct these practices\n-  Customers may use an alternative 3rd party if they prefer, however if this 3rd party has never used the Measurabl system before they should likely get engaged earlier so they are up to speed on the tool. It's important that the customer keep all parties informed of expectations/timelines.\n-  Measurabl can answer questions from verifiers regarding methodology/data collection but may need to escalate some questions back to the customer\n-  It's important that all data to be assured/verified is in Measurabl by April - this does not mean you need absolute data completeness but rather that all data they plan to submit to GRESB is entered in Measurabl\n\nh2. *3rd Party Assurance/Verification Process Overview*\n\n-  Project is PMed by Assurance/Verifier\n-  *Timeline:* 2-4 months.\n\n--  All utility data must be in Measurabl to begin.\n--  Standard process is to start March with initial conversations and Assurance statement will be issued in June for reports. Please see below for in depth review.\n-  CSM common questions - answered at bottom.\n\nh2. *Assurance/Verification Timeline*\n\n*1) Establish Client Interest:*\n\n-  1) Client brings it up\n-  2) or CS M brings up as a way to have investment grade data/same confidence in sustainability data as financial data and/or a way to increase points.\n-  [Template email |https://app.hubspot.com/templates/565185/edit/5513998?folder=2393805&folderName=Marketplace&page=1]with cost, timeline, and benefits.\n\n*2)* *Once client confirms:*\n\n-  CS rep connects with Mel\n-  Client executes Order Form\n\n*3) Assurance/Verification Process begins:*\n\n-  Intro and process call with Assurance/ Verification team (~1 hour)\n\n--  Clients, MSR CSM, and Assurance/Verification team.\n--  If assurer/verifier is new to Measurabl or has used before but needs a refresher, CSM to provide short training.\n-  Assurance/Verification process (2-4 months)\n\n--  Assurer/Verifier will communicate directly w/client and CSM to answer any questions regarding data and process.\n--  *List of Findings*\n\n--  Assurers/Verifiers will create a list of findings that must be explained before the issuance of a statement can occur. The *client* should lead the charge toward resolution, but will likely ask for assistance from the CSM where needed. Once findings are resolved, a statement should be issued.\n\n*4) Issuance of Assurance/Verification Statement*\n\n-  Once the assurer/verifier has confirmed the issuance of a statement, they should provide two documents to the client and CSM:\n\n--  (1) Verification Report\n--  (2) Verification/Assurance Statement\n-  The Verification/Assurance Statement (2) is the document that should be uploaded to GRESB (PI1.4, 2.3, 3.4, 4.2)\n\nh2. *CSM Common Questions*\n\n-  *What is 3rd party assurance, and why would customers be interested in it? How does it affect their GRESB score?*\n-  Assurance, however, confirms that reports are held to the same standard as financial data, which has stricter standards than non-financial data and must be performed by an accredited third party auditor (such as pWc, LRQA, or Deloitte). Reports with assurance will have all calculations, data collection and analysis processes, and data quality checked.\n-  Read more [here|https://www.measurabl.com/blog/how-assurance-and-verification-help-your-sustainability-efforts/] and [here|https://www.measurabl.com/blog/alignment-assurance-and-verification/]\n-  *How does billing work between the customer, the 3rd party and us?*\n-  Our customers pay us the pricing on their contract or pricing page. We then pay our partners. If client is asking for deliverable within 60 days of due date there is a $150 rush fee.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88739/ydBlH4Ryw5XBWMe5WALGVbMEn1QqJpTPURwMAa21.png|alt=ydBlH4Ryw5XBWMe5WALGVbMEn1QqJpTPURwMAa21.png!1. *When would you use ISOS vs. LRQA, and is this a decision the customer is involved in?*\n  1. No decision does not involve customer, unless they used either for previous reporting. Mel decides.\n2. *Can customers get their data assured if they don't use Usync or Energy Star?*\n  1. Yes. But U Sync makes it easier because assurance team needs to see bills for 5-10% of sites\n3. *Is there any criteria that would make a customer ineligible for this service?*\n  1. Lack of data.\n4. *Is there a cost difference if they want to change the scope?*\n  1. Flat fee. Scope change would involve conversation with Mel, Assurance team, and client\n5. *Does it matter how large or small their portfolio is?*\n  1. No flat fee.\n6. *Would customer determine which of their properties they want assured, or does ISOS take a sample? Does this affect pricing?*\n  1. Properties included in their GRESB or CDP report are the properties being assured. ISOS then takes a sample of 5-10% for deeper analysis and site phone call interview.\n7. *Does the CSM stay involved through the whole assurance process or does ISOS manage after the first call?*\n  1. Yes, CSM will be triage answering questions from Assurance team around data collection and client’s properties. IF CSM can not answer question, then CSM loops in client. CSM should expect for client's going through assurance process during reporting season should add 4 hours of work/week to workload.\n\nh2. *Assurance Supporting Documentation*\n\nh2. Lessons Learned\n\n-  _Understand the difference and the intent of Verification & Assurance._\n\n--  Verification: not statement of good or bad; it is whether or not data is there and if it’s not, then what are you doing to grab it. Verification process with Quinn & Partners was held up due to differing understandings of the verifying scope of work - for GRESB purposes all that’s needed is a statement implying the above definition. The Q&P team felt the need to verify the level of data completeness, but under the above definition, that is not necessary to issue a verification statement.\n--  Materiality - 5-10% is a threshold that is reported in the verification statement.\n-  _Stick to the timeline._\n\n--  If there are any barriers or delays in the process, elevate these to Courteney immediately. Verification/Assurance occur on a tight timeline.\n-  _Sometimes our conversion factors are not always up-to-date._\n\n--  That's okay, factors are updated all the time - elevate any issues with factors to Sondra/Bri.\n-  _Sometimes verifiers need assistance understanding the Data Quality Export._\n\n--  You can and should take the time to help verifiers understand the system to ensure they can complete their process smoothly.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

How does it affect their GRESB score?*\n-  Assurance, however, confirms that reports are held to the same standard as financial data, which has stricter standards than non-financial data and must be performed by an accredited third party auditor (such as pWc, LRQA, or Deloitte). Reports with assurance will have all calculations, data collection and analysis processes, and data quality checked.\n-  Read more [here|https://www.measurabl.com/blog/how-assurance-and-verification-help-your-sustainability-efforts/] and [here|https://www.measurabl.com/blog/alignment-assurance-and-verification/]\n-  *How does billing work between the customer, the 3rd party and us?*\n-  Our customers pay us the pricing on their contract or pricing page. We then pay our partners. If client is asking for deliverable within 60 days of due date there is a $150 rush fee.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88739/ydBlH4Ryw5XBWMe5WALGVbMEn1QqJpTPURwMAa21.png|alt=ydBlH4Ryw5XBWMe5WALGVbMEn1QqJpTPURwMAa21.png!1. *When would you use ISOS vs. LRQA, and is this a decision the customer is involved in?*\n  1. No decision does not involve customer, unless they used either for previous reporting. Mel decides.\n2. *Can customers get their data assured if they don't use Usync or Energy Star?*\n  1. Yes. But U Sync makes it easier because assurance team needs to see bills for 5-10% of sites\n3. *Is there any criteria that would make a customer ineligible for this service?*\n  1. Lack of data.\n4. *Is there a cost difference if they want to change the scope?*\n  1. Flat fee. Scope change would involve conversation with Mel, Assurance team, and client\n5. *Does it matter how large or small their portfolio is?*\n  1. No flat fee.\n6. *Would customer determine which of their properties they want assured, or does ISOS take a sample? Does this affect pricing?*\n  1. Properties included in their GRESB or CDP report are the properties being assured. ISOS then takes a sample of 5-10% for deeper analysis and site phone call interview.\n7. *Does the CSM stay involved through the whole assurance process or does ISOS manage after the first call?*\n  1. Yes, CSM will be triage answering questions from Assurance team around data collection and client’s properties. IF CSM can not answer question, then CSM loops in client. CSM should expect for client's going through assurance process during reporting season should add 4 hours of work/week to workload.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Google tag manager,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h1. What's a tag?\n\n_Tags_ (or _marketing tags_) are 3rd-party scripts that integrate into our app and marketing website. These are analytics gathering tools (Hubspot, Google Analytics), funnel tracking tools (AdWords), and in-app documentation tools (Zendesk, Whatfix).\n\nIn order to integrate with other apps, services like Hubspot provide javascript snippets that we have to incorporate into our codebase. Typically, these scripts want to load with the rest of the app, but sometimes there's a use case for loading them when a user hits a certain page or performs a certain action.\n\nWhen we're talking about _tags_, we're intechangeably talking about the company that provided the javascript snippet (Hubspot) and the snippet itself (the Hubspot tracking code).\n\nh1. What's [Google Tag Manager|https://tagmanager.google.com/]?\n\nIn order to manage the 3rd-party scripts that are running in our app, we have two options—1) paste the scripts directly into our codebase or 2) use a _tag manager_, a script that pulls in other scripts. The most popular (and freest) tag manager is Google Tag Manager (GTM).\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88732/7JG6mORpB7N5jH2hKJZ15KqralWxYDou5pjYGPtc.png|alt=7JG6mORpB7N5jH2hKJZ15KqralWxYDou5pjYGPtc.png!There are lots of reasons to use a tag manager over direct integrations:\n\n-  They don't require the dev team to test out and implement new tags.\n-  The codebase doesn't need to be re-deployed in order to get new tags or configurations live.\n-  Tag managers offer tools for testing and previewing the results of implementing a new tag.\n-  The interface provides guidance on how to implement tags most effectively.\n-  You set up and manage the rules for when tags will load (_fire_) instead of burdening dev with configuring them.\n\nh1. How does Measurabl use GTM?\n\nWe use GTM to run the following tags:\n\n-  *Google Analytics*\n\n--  For tracking user flows, session duration, and abandonment.\n--  Including tracking certain user events, like button clicks and downloads.\n-  *Hubspot*\n\n--  For tracking conversions from marketing prospects to real app users.\n-  *Zendesk*\n\n--  For displaying our in-app Help widget.\n--  Including setting the Suggested Articles that show up in the widget based on what page the user is viewing.\n-  *Whatfix*\n\n--  For displaying in-app walkthroughs.\n\nh1.

Currently very labour intensive and requiring many steps form multiple people.\n-  Project coordination\n\n--  My experience of onboarding CBRE GI Europe has been that keeping track and reporting on who sent what was tricky, thus making it difficult to let the client know what we're still waiting for (I have meters for this site, but do I have certifications? etc) > categorise 'to dos' and make some of them 'new building' specific and others 'reporting' specific, with the latter category cyclical so that they are unticked every reporting period & include 'to dos' in data quality report\n--  See a. iv. Subgroups not included in site lists exports ('All Group Sites' & 'Data Quality Report') > add a column for 'subgroup'\n-  European competitiveness\n-  See 1. b. EStar. Current workaround is not sustainable and will need to be reversed once USync is decoupled from EStar. Having to create buildings in EStar for USync sites takes away one of Measurabl's major selling points: it's no longer out-of-the-box and requires intervention from the CS team for every single data entry.\n-  Certifications\n\n--  Integration with BRE is a good step. Requires enhancing as not enough information is provided to allow users to decide whether to accept/reject an imported BREEAM certification > include cert. no. and building name from BRE\n--  A site can have multiple EPCs or DGNBs for a same surface type and same period > once tenant spaces are introduced, make sure certifications of a same type and period can be assigned to different tenant spaces\n-  Languages\n\n--  Must offer a multi-lingual platform in order to win business from European companies. At cr360, we only had 1 non-UK/US based client who only used English: Nestle.\n-  Product SWOT\n-  Strengths\n\n--  Truly out-of-the-box, meaning no setup costs or delays\n--  Modern and slick UI\n--  Excellent UX when reporting to GRESB\n--  Focused on a single sector, meaning the product goes deep not broad\n-  Weaknesses\n\n--  Being completely out-of-the-box means there are a number of settings that are not configurable (user permissions, indicators, etc)\n--  No advanced reporting or forecasting (maybe offer a nice integration to Power BI as standard instead of developing in-house)\n--  No high-res meter data\n--  No manual data collection workflow\n-  Opportunities\n\n--  The shipping industry is finally taking consciousness of its need to go green. There are a lot of similarities to the real estate sector (assets being ships instead of buildings). There's potential to tap in to another sector without broadening or weakening the product.\n--  Same goes with States & Cities: very similar to the Real Estate sector. Many States & Cities now belong to organisations such as C40 or Global Covenant of Mayors and are required to report to CDP.\n--  Having so much data is an advantage. Expand the benchmarking features (intra and inter portfolio)\n--  High-res metering could be an optional module > additional revenue\n--  Be an early adopter of the CDP API\n-  Threats\n\n--  If GRESB loses traction or ceases to exist, Measurabl loses its USP (best integration to GRESB)\n--  Lack of advanced energy analytics opens up the door to competitors such as cr360, Schneider, Enablon etc for clients who do not wish to have multiple tools to answer all their Energy data needs.\n--  Same goes with lack of configuration. Not every client only uses sustainability software to report to frameworks. Many have internal KPIs and produce their own sustainability reports. Companies such as British Land, Grosvenor Group and Gecina set the bar high in Europe and would not find Measurabl sufficient. Competitors currently offer more functionality and can better meet those needs.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

In a best case scenario, you will have taken the necessary steps preceding this moment to relationship build, understand a prospect's requirement and steer them away from this process.\n\n*Definition*: A request for proposal is a document that solicits suppliers that offer(s) a commodity, service, or valuable asset . Often made through a bidding process where response frameworks are provided (Doc, XLSX) or customized by suppliers.\n\nAn RFP process can be broken down into a handful of scenarios (albeit curve balls come all the time) with subsequent steps:\n\nh3. (1) RFI\n\nThese are typically issued before the RFP and is just a discovery process. MSR provides documentation of our value proposition and offering. Prospects who do this are curious to see what is available in the market.\n\nIf you can define what the current market challenges are in the RFI and how Measurabl has solved them, then you are positioned for a successful RFP process.\n\nh3. *(2) Invitation*\n\nTypically sent via email:\n\n'Company X is issuing this announcement to serve as notification of our upcoming Request for Proposal (RFP) for..\n\nWe are pleased to extend this invitation to you. If you would like to submit a proposal, please confirm your contact information by replying to this email with the following details before '_x date'_ to receive instructions outlining the NDA, notice of intention and RFP guidelines:\n\n• Company name\n\n• Contact person (First Name, Last Name)\n\n• Email address\n\n• Telephone number..'\n\nThere may be additional documentation such as an non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which needs to be executed by Measurabl's COO.\n\nh3. (3*) RFP Issued*\n\nThe prospect will provide a Word Doc or PDF detailing the framework and SOW (scope of work) for the RFP.\n\nCommon sections are:\n\n-  Introduction\n-  Background on Company\n-  RFP Objectives and goals\n-  Requirements\n-  Guidlines for reponse\n-  Pricing Schedule\n-  Timelines & Key Dates\n\nOther common items are: Terms and Conditions, MSA (master services agreement), Key Dates\n\nh3. (4) *Complete RFP*\n\nThis process needs to be detail oriented and meticulous. Moreover, pulling resources from other departments (dev, product, CS) will be critical. Typical sections included in an RFP (but not limited to) are:\n\n-  Vendor history\n-  Data collection\n-  Reporting\n-  Data Quality\n-  Security\n-  Support\n-  References\n-  Pricing\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWe have a standard template in that can be found in Drive SalesRFP Materials[Sustainability Software template_SOURCE FILE|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pV3K8mxUmusTSjKQa-I4hKgdumhh3zqGaxBzOu_G1Dg/edit#gid=1928490013]\n\nh3. (5) *RFP Submission*\n\nBefore submitting the RFP, you will need to submit a draft to SVP Marc Rehberger for review and approval. Once a vFinal is approved, follow the steps the prospect dictated in the SOW.\n\n_**Note: Following submission protocols is critical as some groups request submission by email, flash-drive or even physical paper. Failure to follow instructions correctly could result in automatic disqualification._\n\nh3. (6) *Post Submission next steps*\n\nThe prospect will generally provide a timeline for the process as they need time to evaluate vendors.

Background & Notes\n\nThe Postman call you're doing is essentially a database vlookup of all the sites with USync issues and all the users across Measurabl. When there's a site in Measurabl that has a USync issue but no associated PM the Group Owner will be included in the list of users to email.\n\nUnfortunately, this big vlookup does not work well when there's a USync error on a campus sub-building* as the user can only be invited to the campus (all sub-buildings are rolled up to the campus on the Data page even though you can activate accounts on the sub-buildings in Utility Sync). This means that PMs for sub-buildings are never contacted to fix those issues unless they also have an error about another non-sub-building. It also means that Group Owners are always emailed if there's an issue on a sub-building even though there may be proper PM invitations happening on the campus level.\n\nFR Ticket for enhancement to make this process transactional instead of manual: [FR#396|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/feature-requests/tickets/396]\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"
page,Gresb certification approval,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""GRESB now requires that custom certs get approved. They also significantly expanded their list of approved certs.\n\nh2. New List of Approved Certifications\n\nGRESB has significantly expanded their list of approved certifications. Appendix A has the full list of GRESB approved certifications. We'll be adding those to our list of certifications, but they aren't yet available in our system. Check that list to see if the cert you need is on the list, if so, you don't need to get approvalit's already approved. We'll have that cert available in our system in the next few weeks. A few of the certs are in foreign languages. I used Google translate to get a rough translation and included that in brackets next to the official certification name.\n\nh2. Approval Process\n\nFor certs that aren't on the GRESB list of preapproved certs, you have to fill out the Evaluation form below and send that to info@gresb.com (just fyi, Weiwen is the one handling the certs for gresb).\n\nh2. New Measurabl Features (Upcomingnot implemented yet)\n\nWe'll be adding some features to our system to support this new workflow. [FR239|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/feature-requests/tickets/realtime_cardwall?tickets_report_id=filter:u3826833&ticket=329]\n\nCS will get an email when a user enters a new custom cert. CS can ask DEV (Lance or John S) to mark Custom Certs as Accepted or Rejected and we’ll flip that bit in the database (no admin ui this year). Until that happens, all custom certs are “pending” and don’t get included in the GRESB rollup. If CS needs a list of pending Certs just ask and we’ll query the database.\n\nThere will be a flag to indicate if a custom cert is Pending/Approved/Rejected.\n\nCustom Certs will be hidden from the GRESB certification rollup until it is approvedapproved custom certs will be included in the GRESB certification rollup table.\n\nh2.

page,Goby,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""GOBY is a tech enabled consultancy that leverages the SalesForce platform for 'software.' Based out of Chicago and our main competitor\n\n*Key Differentiators:*\n\n-  *Many of their customers are unhappy and feel they were oversold:* We consistently beat Goby in RfPs and the vast majority of consequential players in the market use Measurabl, or are in process of switching to us. I am happy to connect you to a Goby customer near you who is planning the switch now to hear first hand the reality of the service they were promised versus what was actually delivered.\n-  *Non-proprietary software:* The primary differentiator between Measurabl and Goby is that they bundle consulting services with their Salesforce (“Seasuite') software whereas we partner on services so we can excel at software and our partners excel at service: the best of both worlds. This has led to large differences in the quality of our software versus Goby to the point that Salesforce is an investor in Measurabl and would not invest in Goby The consequence of working on non-proprietary software is that Goby has to address its software limitations by putting ever more people in place to cover up the cracks. The more people, the more mistakes, fatigue, expense, and back and forth you will encounter. What starts out sounding like the perfect solution ends up being painful and expensive death-by-consultant.\n-  *Their former employees:* Our COO, Dana, came from Goby and knows well their claim to “do it all” is not what it sounds like. You will notice this in the extreme around GRESB reporting which their system cannot handle end-to-end, but also in the quality of your utility automation service and day-to-day blocking and tackling at the property level. The volume of spreadsheets you and your property managers face will increase while the quality of your ESG program will decrease. You will be stuck with ever more consulting as their proposed solution.\n-  *Measurabl consulting partners are best in class:* From Verdani to SIG we have nationally known consulting partners who also routinely compete against Goby and can describe their experience. You have preferred access to the Partners. I am confident they can solve any non-software needs you may have at lower cost with less friction. These partners also know how to use Measurabl so are integrated into our ecosystem. From SL Green to Parmenter, the partner model has been very effective at providing the exact support you need, when you need it, at lower cost.\n-  *Validation:* From our exclusive partnership with GRESB, to our market leading integrations with USGBC, to our 6.5BN square feet of adoption - at every turn Measurabl is more endorsed, more integrated, and far more widely adopted than Goby. If your goal is to scale TA’s program, then you will certainly want to do it on the most scalable software, not fall back to non-scalable consulting.\n\nh2. Services\n\n-  *Utility Data collection (via Urjanet) and storage (ENERGY STAR and cloud)* Similar to our Usync\n-  *Bill Pay* This is a new service for them.

Matt and Gary were not present.\n\nCBRE GWS works with CBREGI, DB and a lot of other shared clients. They don't want their clients to have to use multiple sustainability tech solutions to deliver results. 'everyone is using measurabl' :) @Matt Ellis\n\n*_Opportunities_*\n\n-  Current Process and Services from Sustainability 'Tech' Providers @Sondra Tosky\n-  The team spends a lot of time managing, cleaning and prepping data for a variety of building sustainability certifications (LEED, ARC, BREEAM) across two platforms.\n\n--  Using *Sustainability Dashboard* ('SD') for data tracking and management for their sustainability consulting services (internally used by CBRE team). Plan was to transition to Goby, but do to lack of data quality, they have stopped the transition.\n\n--  The data they are gathering is more than what MSR does. They are gathering pest reports, purchasing documentation for the MC LEED credits. Melissa sees this form of data dying in the coming years and is not looking for a solution to replace this.\n--  The SD team will follow up with vendors to gather all of the needed data for them. (Goby kind of does this too).\n--  Using *Goby* for task management for volume LEED projects. (They are okay using goby for this until this service dies)\n\n--  They create projects in Goby's SF platform and assign questions/tasks to users for LEED projects. \n     1. A credit is assigned to a user. On the task, a template document is uploaded that the user downloads, completes and then re-uploads. Marks the task as complete.\n     2. Melissa's team has the ability to see a dashboard of completed tasks, tasks by due date, tasks by assignee all for them to manage all of the work that needs to be complete for a success and on time project submission.\n-  Future desires/use cases from a software platform\n-  Customizable survey to a site manager (site level) (to replace 'task' management as well as expand to information gathering in general). (RioCan has expressed this need as well)\n\n--  a process facilitated by technology to\n\n--  Ask for data from a Property Manager ('PM') \n     1. quantitative, qualitative and document completion asks for sustainability reporting and certification\n--  Gather data from a PM \n     1. provide a place to gather this data\n--  Report on data as a group \n     1. provide a way to see across all of the surveys to see the data\n     2. Manage what data is there and not there - to follow up on the missing items that were asked for.\n-  Portfolio level tracking of prescribed activities\n\n--  They have portfolios that they sell a sustainability package that includes project management on a wide variety of activities, the team would like to assign and track progress on completing these asks\n\n--  Example - Year 1 - every building with do a water audit and complete one water improvement project\n-  What are bigger picture items that you would like to solve with technology?\n-  Analytics supporting best service for an asset or portfolio to purchase - What is the best certification and value add path for sustainability improvement in your asset and/or portfolio?\n\n--  Melissa has a spreadsheet she as built with data inputs to help her assess a group of buildings to come to her clients with recommended pathways to improve portfolio for GRESB. This is a very time intensive process, but needed to sell their services at scale.\n\n--  What are my 5 worst properties and what should we do with them to improve?\n--  What are my best candidates for LEED?\n--  Would we do better on LEED or BREEAM? What are the predicted scores and costs?\n--  If we do 5 LEED projects, how will that impact our GRESB score?\n-  Wants to think about what she needs 6- 12 months done the road.\n-  Consultant Partner\n-  BOMA - interested in being the verifier, wants fees to be a little bit higher, will come back with a number they would like for this service.\n-  Consulting Services - They want referrals for LEED, BREEAM work (not interested in ESTAR or Ordinance support).\n\nAdditional Notes\n\n-  They really want Invesco from Lord Green. They apparently pay Lord Green between $2,500-5,000/year a building for the work LG is doing (surveys, data management, etc.). They use us via Greenprint. Looks like @Melissa Bartow has some insight into this on how we can expand that relationship, but is held very closely by Michelle Lord.\n-  She has heard from multiple people that 'Measurabl is just a GRESB tool' and Envisi is a 'sustainability tool.' This is a view that we need to change through marketing as we do everything and MORE than envisi @Kelia Cowan\n-  She was shocked at our cheap prices for our pro model, designed to be used by consultants.\n\nNext steps:\n\n-  Dana to follow up with links and instructions to create a demo account with their ESTAR account to see the tool in action.\n-  Complete a demo with their data in our tool in the coming weeks\n-  Matt to create a deal in hubspot to track\n-  Further discuss technology needs to support our 'consultants'\n-  Establish agreement to be the service provider and partner (they want to go to market with the full package - consulting and software)\n-  Refine BOMA partnership with CBRE with costs\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

Customer Description\n\nThis customer has an existing Energy Star account and they want to start using Usync for all data collection in the future. They are very comfortable and hands-on with their Energy Star account, but they’re wary of the account data getting “messed up” when there’s many cooks in the kitchen.\n\n*More about the customer:*\n\n-  Hands on with ESPM\n-  Existing Data in ESPM, excited about moving towards data automation\n-  Naive (not fully aware of the time and process to transition into utility data automation)\n-  Can OR cannot delegate to site managers\n\n*Subtypes of this customer:*\n\nA. Group Manager runs everything (bulk utility account set up)\n\nB. Multiple Group Managers running various groups/funds/regions (bulk utility account set up/manual sync)\n\nC. Site managers operating from site level\n\n*What will this customer need to learn?*\n\nThis customer will need to learn how to activate utility sync accounts, deactivate utility sync accounts, and resolve customer issues. This customer needs to be a power user of Utility Sync and needs to be able to guide site managers on using the system.\n\nh2. Important Notes for Setting Expectations\n\nBaseline account set-up process will vary depending on site manager delegation. If no site manager delegation, the user will fill out the Utility Sync bulk upload sheet and identify start dates for all utility sync meters to avoid overlaps. Additionally, it is important to set expectations of QA/QC efforts on MSR’s end. The process will also vary depending on customer site volume and whether the user has concierge service.\n\n*Expectations for Customer*\\\nHandle all connecting and sharing with MSR in ESTAR\\\nProvide first draft of Utility Sync bulk upload\\\nAddress all QA/QC issues in bulk upload and Utility Sync errors related to data they provided\n\n*Expectations for MSR*\\\nQA/QC with Utility Sync gaps and overlaps (only Measurabl meters). \\\nOn-boarding is complete once all accounts are synced (this is with no site manager delegation). \\\nNo issues around overlaps or start/inactive dates with Energy Star (one time clean up). \\\nPrepare “Percent Complete” sheet to visualize for the customer which sites are synced and which are not\n\nh1.

page,New construction major renovation,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""What is it? GRESB defines the lifecycle phases of a site below:\n\n*Major Renovations:* Alterations that affect more than 50 percent of the total building floor area or cause relocation of more than 50 percent of regular building occupants. Major renovation projects refer to buildings that were under construction at any time during the reporting period.\n\n*New Construction:* Includes all activities to obtain or change building or land use permissions and financing. Includes construction work for the project with the intention of enhancing the property’s value. Development of new buildings and additions to existing buildings that affect usable space can be treated as new constructions and reported in RC-NC1. New construction projects refer to buildings that were under construction at any time during the reporting period.\n\n*Standing Investments:* Real estate properties where construction work has been completed and which are owned for the purpose of leasing and producing rental income. The level of occupancy is not relevant for this definition. Also known as operating buildings.\n\nh2. FAQ\n\n*Are Audits and/or Projects performed during New Construction or Major Renovation included in RO4?*\n\nNo. Projects and Audits are focused primarily on actions undertaken to improve the efficiency of an existing building. New Constructions or Major Renovations are overhauls in which building components are not considered individual projects but rather parts of the entire 'New Construction Project' or 'Major Renovation Project'. Anything being built in present should ideally be up to high standards. Measurabl accounts for this by excluding projects catalogued during the NCMR period from the project roll-up page, however, NCMR projects in alignment with green building standards can be accounted for in NC5.1.\n\n*Is my utility data included in LFL comparison? Is it included in absolute? How does it affect my score?*\n\n_Example 1:_ New Construction ends before the 24-month GRESB reporting period.\n\n-  All utility data collected (if any) during New Construction is excluded from the GRESB report entirely (not even in NCMR section). GRESB does not care about utility data during this period because it's so variable and impossible to benchmark. Measurabl accounts for this by excluding any data collected before the New Construction end date from the GRESB performance indicators.\n-  All utility data collected after the New Construction period is included in the *_ABSOLUTE_* consumption buckets for reporting purposes - these values are *_NOT_* scored. Measurabl accounts for this by including any data collected after the period of New Construction in the absolute bucket of the PI section.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88724/DRRk59hCqkJCI6yoPrKwyiG0IBmHD7VTGxpYFgvi.png|alt=DRRk59hCqkJCI6yoPrKwyiG0IBmHD7VTGxpYFgvi.png!_Example 2:_ Major Renovation occurs in middle of 24-month GRESB reporting period.\n\n-  Like New Construction, all utility data collected (if any) during Major Renovation is excluded from the GRESB report entirely. Measurabl accounts for this by excluding any data collected between the start and end date listed for Major Renovation from the GRESB performance indicators. Measurabl accounts for this like it does New Construction, by using the dates as guidelines to exclude data.\n-  All utility data collected before and after the dates listed for Major Renovation is included in the *_ABSOLUTE_* consumption buckets for reporting purposes - these values are *_NOT_* scored.\n\n_Example 3:_ New Construction ends after the 24-month GRESB reporting period.\n\n-  No data from this site is included in survey aside from questions asked in NCMR aspect.\n\n*Are Certifications and Ratings achieved during New Construction and/or Major Renovation included in my* survey?\n\n_Certificates_\n\nYes, in fact, there are two places within the survey to report this information. BC1.1 asks 'Does the entity’s portfolio include standing investments that obtained a green building certificate at the time of design, construction, and/or renovation?' and NC5.2 asks 'Does the entity’s new construction and major renovation portfolio NC5.2 include projects that obtained or are registered to obtain a green building certificate?' These questions do not include a time frame for receiving certification (i.e. past 4 years) they simply require reporting certificates received. Measurabl accounts for this by including certificates received during NCMR project periods in BC1.1. Any certificates received outside of NCMR dates are bucketed into BC1.2, as they are considered 'operational building certificates'.\n\n_Ratings_\n\nNo. All acceptable GRESB ratings are based off of energy efficiency measures that generally require 12 months of operational building data. If an NCMR project is aligned with green building standards, this can be reported in NC5.1.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Site anomaly detector,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h1. Site Anomaly Detector\n\nVersion 25, last updated by [juliusr|https://measurabl.assembla.com/profile/juliusr] at 2018-04-23\n\nThe purpose of this anomaly detection is to retire the engine that generates the 'Schumann' [data quality alerts|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/wiki/Client_Data_Quality_Alerts] and replace the rules with data driven ones developed from the MSR data set.\n\nThere are three methods to anomaly detection at the site level.\n\n-  Intensity anomalies\n-  Cost per unit anomalies\n-  Month over Month intensity variance anomaliesThese mothods cover electric, water, fuel and district utility data on all sites thats are active and part of a whitelisted group.\n\nh3. Intensity AnomaliesThe strategy to detect these anomalies is to look at our data in distinct slices. The way we slice the data is by GRESB property type and then by month. The assumption is that each property type has a different intensity profile that is seasonally affected and thus changes with each month.\n\nOnce the data is sliced into into consituant pieces, we find the best distribution that fits our data slice and use that as the model of our intensity data. With this model we define an intensity outlier have a very high value of the Cummulative Density Function. This effectively makes the sites with the highest intensity outliers our anomalies.\n\nThe below chart illustrates this approach. The red dashed line on the left is the distribution fit to our electric intensity data for GRESB property type Industrial: Manufacturing for March. The right chart shows the scatter plot of floor area and electric usage of all Industrial: Manufacturing for March. The red dots are what have been identified as outliers using the distribution illustrated in the chart on the left.\n\n!https://www.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/documents/cVcSSy5Emr54pcacwqjQXA/download/cVcSSy5Emr54pcacwqjQXA!### Cost per Unit AnomaliesThe strategy to detect is very similar as the intensity anomalies but the data slices are much different. We only slice the data for utility types. The assumption is that the cost of electricity does not very much by season or by GRESB property type. The goal is to find true anomalous data, not discvoer subtle geographic differences in our data.\n\nAgain, once the data is sliced into into consituant pieces, we find the best distribution that fits our data slice and use that as the model of our cost per unit data. With this model we define an intensity outlier have a very high value of the Cummulative Density Function. This effectively makes the sites with the highest cost per unit outliers our anomalies.\n\nThe below chart illustrates this approach. Our data contains such egregious outliers that some of our customers have reported paying as much as $3,000,000/MWH which can be seen in the chart on the left. The scatter plot on the right has the anomalous data points as red dots again.\n\n!https://www.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/documents/ag2Tlm5ECr54hdacwqEsg8/download/ag2Tlm5ECr54hdacwqEsg8!### Month over Month Intensity Variance AnomaliesThe strategy to detect these anomalies is to look at our data in distinct slices. The way we slice the data is by GRESB property type and then by month over month percent change. The assumption is that each property type has a different intensity profile that is seasonally affected and thus changes with each month.\n\nOnce the data is sliced into into consituant pieces, we find the best distribution that fits our data slice and use that as the model of our intensity data. With this model we define an intensity outlier have a very high value of the Probability Density Function. This value is derived by finding the 'elbow' of the PDF (denoted by black cross-hair on left plot below). This effectively makes the sites with the highest intensity outliers our anomalies.\n\n##\n\n!https://www.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/documents/bYmA9Q9nir56Ncdmr6CpXy/download/bYmA9Q9nir56Ncdmr6CpXy!The chart above shows the PDF and Outliers for GRESB properety type _'Indurstrial: Distribution Warehouse_' for March, 2017.### How to Run the detector and dump anomalies to a sheet for CS analysisShell into the science server and execute the command\n\n{{<strong>cd /gnb/science</strong>}}\n\n{{<strong>sudo -u web ./run_science.sh site_anomaly_detector</strong>}}\n\nThis will take around 5 minutes to complete. Once it has completed execute the following query in the PROD DB or Replica to get the latest list of site anomalies for CS.\n\n{{SELECT g.name AS group_name, <br></br>       IF(sa.source='ENERGYSTAR',eb.name,mb.name) AS building_name, <br></br>       sa.year, <br></br>       sa.month, <br></br>       sa.anomaly_type, <br></br>       sa.confidence AS severity, <br></br>       CONCAT('https://app.measurabl.com/admin/users/',g.primary_user_id,'/groups/',sa.msr_id,'/data-management/real-estate/',sa.source,'/',sa.building_id,'/trends') AS admin_link <br></br>FROM science.site_anomalies sa <br></br>JOIN railmodel.groups g <br></br>  ON sa.msr_id=g.id <br></br>LEFT JOIN msr.estar_buildings eb <br></br>       ON sa.source='ENERGYSTAR' <br></br>      AND sa.msr_id=eb.msr_id <br></br>      AND sa.building_id=eb.estar_id <br></br>LEFT JOIN msr.manual_buildings mb <br></br>       ON sa.source='MANUAL' <br></br>      AND sa.msr_id=mb.msr_id <br></br>      AND sa.building_id=mb.building_id;<br></br><br></br><br></br>In drive.measurabl.com in team drives/DEV/Science create a new spread sheet named <date>-site-anomalies and paste in the contents of the above query.}}\n\nh2. What is auto-labeling?Auto-labelling is a process in which we infer that a an anomaly is actually an anomaly by detecting that it is fixed. The method used to determine this is naive. If an anomaly exists, and it disappears, we simply assume that it must have been fixed. Thus, the site_anomaly_detector.py will change the label of these anamaliess to 1 from NULL. This servies 2 goals: it helps us collect labeled data in an an automated fasion, and it simplifies the workflow for front end users.\n\nh2. Expected ValuesRelated Tickets:\n\n[#7419|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/tickets/7419], [#7429|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/tickets/7429], [#7509|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/tickets/7509], [#7510|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/tickets/7510]\n\nExpected Values refer to the following values:\n\n-  expected_usage (slope of linear regression - multiply by actual floor area)\n-  expected_spend (slope of linear regression - multiply by actual usage)\n-  expected_mom (% month-over-month change)\n\nExpected values are stored in the following science tables:\n\n-  site_anomaly_expected_values (expected_usage, expected_mom)\n-  site_anomaly_expected_cost_per_unit_values (expected_spend)and are loaded from the following model file:\n-  expected_values.jsonThese tables are used in view_site_anomalies which is used by the front end to power the Data Quality Alerts.\n\nThe expected values are derived from various population groups with different granularities. This is because site anomalies are derived from models which are trained on different populations, i.e. Cost Per Unit anomalies are grouped by metric only.\n\nh3. site_anomaly_expected_values.pyThis script reads the JSON model and updates the appropiate rows in the appropiate science tables.\n\n*Load*\n\nExpected values are loaded from the JSON file to their science tables via the following script: site_anomaly_expected_values.py\n\n{{python site_anomaly_expected_values.py load This script should be invoked whenever there expected_value.json file is updated/retrained.}}\n\n*Train*\n\nTraining should occur on the science box against produciton data. The site_anomaly_expected_values.py script can be used to update the model file:\n\n{{python site_anomaly_expected_values.py train}}\n\nThis does not automatically commit the updated model. This is a manual process.\n\n*SQL Example*\n\n{{SELECT *<br></br>FROM science.site_anomalies s<br></br>LEFT JOIN science.site_anomaly_expected_values ev <br></br>   ON ev.month = s.month<br></br>   AND ev.metric = s.metric<br></br>   AND ev.gresb_type = s.gresb_type<br></br>LEFT JOIN science.site_anomaly_expected_cost_per_unit_values evcpu <br></br>   ON evcpu.metric = s.metric<br></br>}}\n\nh2. Retraining Models\n\nWhen retraining, take into account the following:\n\n-  any unlabeled anomalies with notes need to be manually labeled\n-  unlabeled anomalies will need to be deleted and rescored to prevent them from being auto-labled (site_anomaly_delete.py)\n\nh3. site_anomaly_delete.pyRelated Tickets:\n\n[#7500|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/tickets/7500], [#7604|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/tickets/7604]\n\n*_In Progress: working to automatically call this from deploy_science_models.yml (_*[*_#7604_*|https://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/tickets/7604]*_)_*\n\nThe script allows us to delete unlabeled anomalies which are affected by retrained models. This will prevent anomalies from erroneously being auto-labeled by the site_anomaly_detector. The script will also backup the affected anomalies to a temporary table for alter analysis or restoration if needed.\n\nThe script has optional parameters to selectively delete slices of anomalies by particular model attributes.\n\n{{-m, --months <br></br>-g, --gresb-types <br></br>-M, --metrics <br></br>-t, --anomaly-types}}\n\nNote that *NOT* passing in any of the optional parameters is equivalent to passing in *ALL* available choices for that parameter.\n\nThe following will delete all unlabeled COST_PER_UNIT anomalies:\n\n{{<br></br>python site_anomaly_delete.py --anomaly-types COST_PER_UNIT}}\n\nMultiple values can be passed for each argument to select all combinations.\n\nThe following will delete all unlabeled anomalies for the months Febuary and March and which have a metric of FUEL or WATER\n\n{{<br></br>python site_anomaly_delete.py --months 2 3 --metrics FUEL WATER}}\n\nPassing in no parameters deletes all unlabeled anomalies:\n\n{{<br></br>python site_anomaly_delete.py}}\n\nThis last example will is most common use case as we generally will be retraining all models at once.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

If someone doesn’t know what a bond is (let alone a bond-rating) don’t waste your breath on that topic._\n\nh1. *Value in Dollars and Cents*\n\nThree points are broadly applicable, when you can properly measure and manage, you can gain:\n\n-  Lower cost of capital (lower interest rates)\n-  Higher paying tenants (more rent revenue)\n-  Lower cost of utilities and resource consumption as a whole (lower utility bill)\n\nh1. *Analogies*\n\nPeople love analogies, here are two that cover most cases: bond ratings and credit scores.\n\nh2. *Bond Ratings*\n\nFor anyone with exposure to the financial world, bond-ratings and ratings agencies may be the best analogy. (See note about objective credit ratings*)\n\nAsk anyone with bond market knowledge: _'Why do bond ratings and agencies exist?'_\n\nThey may answer their own questions about Measurabl in the process.\n\nBond ratings and the agencies behind them provide a service to both the borrowing and lending side of the industry.\n\nFor lenders, the equations are simple:\n\n{{higher rating = lower risk = lower interest rate<br></br>lower rating = higher risk = higher interest rate}}\n\nFor borrowers, the way to secure a lower rate is objective and transparent, thanks to the rating systems.\n\n*Measurabl does the exact same thing with a different set of data.*\n\nInvestors (lenders) know objectively and transparently the risk level of an investment.\n\nBorrowers know (again, objectively and transparently) how to secure a lower interest rate.\n\nh2. Credit Scores\n\nFor the 'consumer' audience out there without financial industry knowledge. Credit Scores are pretty well known and their impact understood.\n\n_'Why do you want a better credit score? And, how do you get a better credit score?'_\n\nMaybe to get a lower mortgage rate, credit card approval, rental application approval. Lots of reasons to raise your score.\n\nIf they don't know how to raise their score, then basically Measurabl is solving that problem for the ESG market.\n\nIf they do know, then Measurabl is creating [their credit score tool** of choice] for the ESG market.\n\nh1. *Concise Conclusion*\n\nAsk people: _'Why do credit scores (or bond ratings) exist?'_\n\nAnd follow with: _'What did everyone do before they existed?'_\n\nMeasurabl is bridging the gap between the time in history before objective and transparent ESG data and after.\n\nh1. *Notes*\n\nh3. ** Objective credit ratings*\n\n“As an industry, credit ratings agencies began to recognize that objective credit ratings significantly helped issuers: They faciliated access to [capital,|https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp] by increasing a securities issuer's value in the market place, and decreased the costs of obtaining capital. Expansion and complexity in the [capital markets |https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalmarkets.asp]coupled with an increasing demand for statistical and analytical services led to the industry-wide decision to charge issuers of securities fees for [ratings services|https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ratingsservice.asp].”\n\nRead more: [A Brief History Of Credit Rating Agencies|https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/history-credit-rating-agencies.asp#ixzz5Ca1rf5Wq] [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/history-credit-rating-agencies.asp#ixzz5Ca1rf5Wq|https://www.investopedia.com/articles/bonds/09/history-credit-rating-agencies.asp#ixzz5Ca1rf5Wq]\n\nh3. *** Credit score tools*\n\nMany credit card companies, as well as places like [mint.com|http://mint.com/] allow you to see your score.

page,System methodologies for conversions ghg green house gas estimates,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""This wiki is a place to make internal notes on system-wide calculations and some generic survey quantitative methodologies that aren't directly related to survey boilerplates.\n\nh2. *Emissions factors*\n\nTo see a list of emissions factors go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Bh6fT0GDaodHaDmheLsOBmzX3kpG5saZ-AXNrYzaKE/edit#gid=0\\\nUS Electricity: Egrid2016\\\nGlobal Warming Potential (GWP): IPCC AR5\n\nh2. \nMWH Energy and Water M3 and Waste Conversions\n\nMeasurabl conversions use most recent tab:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OeyloPlfGoc6t1vPcBYfVzvYOjjTDnWcAnlVxAgtwfo/edit#gid=147309243|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OeyloPlfGoc6t1vPcBYfVzvYOjjTDnWcAnlVxAgtwfo/edit#gid=147309243]\n\nWaste: tons to MT 0.907185\n\nh2. *Intensity EUI*\n\nFor GRESB, the denominator for intensity is the *landlord-paid* portion of the building  we subtract any 'paid-by-tenant' portion.\\\nFor CDP, the denominator is the *non-tenant* portion  we subtract any tenant portion (regardless of payor). This methodology is used for all emissions types\n\nh2. *Uncertainty and Estimations*\n\n'Max Scope-1 Certainty'  currently .98\\\n'Max Scope-2 location-based Certainty'  currently .95'Max Scope-2 market-based Certainty when provider-specific emissions are available'  currently .96'Max Scope-2 renewable zero emissionscurrently .96\\\n'Max Estimate Certainty'  currently .6\n\nEstimates based on actual meter readings are 'max' as shown based on whether we're doing scope 1 or scope 2. Estimates *start* at a certainty of .6 for pro-rated estimates based on *the specific building's* usage around that date. We then penalize the certainties further as follows. Each of these represents a 10% (.10) penalty to the certainty:\\\n\\\n\n* estimates are penalized if they're based on CBECS averages rather than the building's own data\\\n\\* scope 2 estimates are penalized if they're based on national *overall* estimates rather than specific EGRID parameters (*) because we don't have or recognize the address* CBECS estimates are penalized if they're based on national *overall* estimates rather than specific CBECS types (i.e., because CBECS doesn't have estimates for that type or because we just have an 'Other') Then we average the data together, with the certainties being pro-rated by usage; that is to say, if I have .95 confidence in 9 months of the year with 100 kWh, and .6 confidence in the other 3 months with 30 kWh, then the overall usage is 130 kWh with confidence 87%. We could, if necessary, break down this calculation over a whole portfolio, with some effort. i.e., we could say something like 'over all your 50 buildings you had 522 months of real data and we estimated the remaining 78 months' worth based on national CBECS averages and state emissions factors and thus the overall confidence is XX%'. Market-based uncertainty:Previously, our max scope 2 certainty was 95%. I've kept that the same for location-based scope 2, and I'm using 96% when we have a provider factor. For example, if a building has 50% of its usage from Pepco (known provider factor) and 50% from eGrid the certainty would average out to 95.5% (4.5% uncertainty).\n\nRenewable usage (zero emissions) I've also tagged as 96% certain for market-based. Pretty subtle stuff, but wanted you to know for testing.\n\nh2. *Building Estimation methodology*\n\nFor Estimations, building close/end dates are applied so that estimates are on a number-of-months basis.\n\n*Electricity:*\\\n1. If a site has Actuals for the current year, but some months are missing data, then the Estimate for the missing months is an Avg of the Actual months. \\\n2. If a site has previous year usage, CBECs is used. We can revisit and change that in the future to forward-fill from previous years if desired.\\\n3. If a site does not have any Actuals then CBECs is used based on sqft and building type. We use the GRESB building types.\n\nElectricity is only estimated for the common area sqft for buildings, ie Scope 2. Scope 3 is not estimated for CDP. If actuals are provided for any portion of the building then no estimations are done for the other buildings spaces. Now that we have spaces, we could make this estimation logic smarter to estimate for any spaces that do not have actual usage recorded.\n\nh2. *CDP Facility breakdown Consumption Report*\n\nit's the estimated consumption minus the on-site renewables, which is the number used for location-based emissions. It includes any purchased off-site renewables and could thus be higher than what's used to calculate market-based emissions *Location vs Market-based emissions*See the CDP boilerplate wiki for details (end of document has table for 'Market-based reporting methodology': \\\nhttps://measurabl.assembla.com/spaces/green-in-a-box/wiki/Measurabl_Generated_Answers_-_Boilerplate_CDP_\\\n*Scope 1/2/3:*Scope 1 fuel usage and corresponding emissions by common area or whole building (sqft is only for sites that have fuel, no estimations for CDP)Scope 2 elec/steam usage and corresponding emissions by common area or whole building (sqft is for all active buildings that are not indirectly managed, estimated based on sqft for CDPmake sure no sites are 0 or 1 sqft as that breaks the estimation)Scope 3 is all tenant usage and corresponding emissions (regardless of if tenant or landlord pays bills).\n\n*Flight emissions calcs*\n\n'Short'/'Domestic': 0.17147 kg CO2e per km\\\n'Medium'/'Short International': 0.097 kg CO2e per km\\\n'Long haul': 0.11319 kg CO2e per km Definitions will be:Short/Domestic: <785 km\\\nMedium/Short: 785-3700km\\\nLong: >3700km\n\n[http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools|http://www.ghgprotocol.org/calculation-tools/all-tools]\n\n*Vehicle MPG*\\\nVehicle MPG is average of highway and city mpg from EPA's website: http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml\n\n*https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Bh6fT0GDaodHaDmheLsOBmzX3kpG5saZ-AXNrYzaKE/edit#gid*\\\nMeasurabl uses the following Energy Star waste weight conversions available at:\\\nhttps://portfoliomanager.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/225876328-What-are-the-volume-to-weight-conversion-factors-\n\nh2. GRESB EU EPC\n\nThe basics for floor area weighted scores:\n\nFor regular non-EUEPC ratings, the scores are always numeric. The calculation for GRESB is simply the sum of all building scores multiplied by the portion of the total floor that building represents. For example, for 2 buildings that have the same rating type: (Building A score * Building A floor area + Building B score * Building B floor area) / (Building A floor area + Building B floor area).\n\nEUEPC is special. The user can select an A through G rating, and we'll store numeric values in our system as A = 95, B = 85, C = 75, etc. For GRESB, we'll do our regular calculation with those values and then map the weighted score back to a letter using this scale:\\\nA = 90-100\\\nB = 80-89\\\nC = 70-79\\\nD = 60-69\\\nE = 50-59\\\nF = 40-49\\\nG =<40\n\nExample:\\\nBuilding A is 10,000 sq ft with an A (95)\\\nBuilding B is 10,000 sq ft with a C (75)\\\nWeighted score will be 85 (B)\n\nBuilding A is 1,000 sq ft with an A (95)\\\nBuilding B is 10,000 sq ft with a C (75)\\\nWeight score will be ~76.8 (C)\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

page,Product backlog prioritisation feedback jm,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""Having listened in to the Product Committee meeting held on 24th July 2018, I made the following observations:\n\n1.1 Each feature is scored (out of 20) independently so you can end up with multiple features with the same or similar score. Having 10 features with a score of 10/20 is not that helpful. How do you then prioritise those 10 features?\n\n1.2 Score does not include size so a Feature that takes 1 sprint can have the same score as a Feature that takes 6 months to deliver. This leaves the actual prioritisation down to capacity, which only takes place at the point of scheduling work, and is not visible up front to the rest of the business.\n\n2. Nikk is the only stakeholder I heard on the call and his FR was parked after being discussed. This highlights issues around who attends the Product Committee and how FRs are selected for scoring. Furthermore I'm not sure that rotating voting and non-voting participants is the best way to provide the transparency that process tried to achieve.\n\nThe above coupled with our meeting held on 19th July 2018 leads me to make the following recommendations:\n\n-  Adopt the WSJF scoring methodology:\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89391/2nsMbq1dhsVhjgqpLz3LUxghZ0eq3Pm6hLLsuJ3d.png|alt=2nsMbq1dhsVhjgqpLz3LUxghZ0eq3Pm6hLLsuJ3d.png!This introduces the concept of a 'Cost of Delay' which combines multiple scores already used by Measurabl.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89391/aoSy0z85CGE74FCp4GuZT3JP0Drlt3CbJVHZcvFs.png|alt=aoSy0z85CGE74FCp4GuZT3JP0Drlt3CbJVHZcvFs.png!It also uses the size of the Feature as a weight.\n\nMost importantly, each score users the fibonacci scale, where each number can only be used once. This provides an order of priority instead of a nominal score.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89391/f5dOJNwKCYs7Cv8bSPAtsyKpkDE8CUIFYVugjv6V.png|alt=f5dOJNwKCYs7Cv8bSPAtsyKpkDE8CUIFYVugjv6V.png!To apply this methodology, all backlog features have to be included in the scoring process. Repeating it on a regular basis (bi-monthly). As time passes, a Feature may move up or down the order of priority (e.g. A client milestone influences the time criticality score. 12 months away from the milestone that score is low, 3 months away from the milestone that score is high, so the Feature moves up the backlog).\n\nAs size becomes one of the important scoring elements, it needs to be a known entity at the time of reviewing the backlog. There also needs to be a level-playing field (I've experienced people trying to play the system). Epics should be broken down into Features which can exist in their own right so that they are not held back by their huge size when the business could benefit earlier from chunks of it. Likewise, a Feature should not be broken down into User Stories at the time of scoring so that you end up with 10 small jobs which all score highly instead of 1 which scores low (that's cheating and there is a better way of dealing with genuine small jobs, see below diagram).\n\nI recommend a 3 step approach (which is not as cumbersome as it may sound) :\n\n-  Adding Feature Requests to the Backlog\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89391/gM1AyOt2qZRKPGV3qcWh7rFYyGeG4UHVF77hdFuH.png|alt=gM1AyOt2qZRKPGV3qcWh7rFYyGeG4UHVF77hdFuH.png!Step 1.\n\nEach Stakeholder group should have their own work stream, i.e. a column in the Kanban for them to raise their FRs and prioritise them.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89391/DvzedaXMMhQ6oNR0VSpoLLzz5FnSbU7i4wFpzvUr.png|alt=DvzedaXMMhQ6oNR0VSpoLLzz5FnSbU7i4wFpzvUr.png!Step 2.\n\nThe FR review by the Product Team can take place ad-hoc, as and when Feature Requests are raised, or fairly regularly, to provide quick feedback to the Stakeholder. It is just a case of yea (good point, we should do it) or nay (stupid idea, do this instead). This addresses the 'company vision' score currently used by the Product Committee. The Product Team should already understand the company vision and know whether FRs align to it or not. This step might not even be required when a member of the Product Team is already present during the initial discussion where the need for a FR is identified and is raising it themselves.\n\nStep 3.\n\nA regular (bi-weekly) meeting with the Dev Team should take place, with allocated time (max 2 hours) to review these new FRs. The required outcome is a technical feasibility assessment (it can be done or not) and a job size estimate (XS, S, M, L, XL).\n\nThe Product Team should present FRs to the Dev Team using the order in which they are prioritised in each stakeholder group's list (all the number 1s, then 2s, then 3s, etc). What doesn't get reviewed in the allocated time awaits the next meeting. Estimated FRs can move to the Product Backlog and be prioritised in the next Stakeholder meeting.\n\nThe Product Team should have enough understanding of the FR to present it to the Dev Team. No Stakeholders are required.\n\n-  Reviewing the Backlog\n\nI'm familiar with the term 'Stakeholder meeting', but it's basically the same concept as the Product Committee: a group of people making informed decisions about what FRs should be prioritised.\n\nPS: One reason I prefer the term 'Stakeholder meeting' is because it is clear the stakeholders are participants, whereas a committee has an established membership with a perception that decisions are made in some ivory tower. This is what I believe led you to having rotating members.\n\nIn a Software company there are various stakeholder groups, each with their own work stream and priorities. Having these stakeholder groups represented in the meeting aims to achieve a few things:\n\n-  avoid running solely with a HIPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion)\n-  every stakeholder group participates in the scoring and has an opportunity to influence the priority of FRs\n-  transparency\n\nThe way the scoring works, a stakeholder group cannot mark all their FRs as high priority. They cannot simply shout louder. They need to have their own idea of how they would prioritise their own work stream before coming into the meeting.\n\nThe Product Team usually chairs the meeting. But at Measurabl it makes sense for Matt to do so and represent the strategic direction of the company, with the following stakeholder groups represented:\n\n-  Commercial (Finance, BD & AM)\n-  Customer Success\n-  Development\n-  Product\n-  Strategy (Matt)\n\nEach stakeholder group should be represented in the meeting. It is for the stakeholder group to chose who to send to the meeting. They may chose to send different representatives to different meetings, depending on the FRs being reviewed. They may chose to send multiple representatives to a meeting should different people be championing different FRs. But each stakeholder group still only has 1 voice when it comes to the Cost of Delay scores. Although you don't want the whole company taking part, only the stakeholder group representatives, the meeting should be public in order to increase the transparency of the process. If the meeting was recorded using Zoom, anyone could dial in or watch the recording at a later date (like Product release demos). I think this would remove the need for rotating non-voting members.\n\nI use the word 'voice' and not 'vote' as the stakeholders need to come to a consensus on each score as you have to pick a number from the fibonacci scale.\n\nThe meeting runs in this order:\n\n-  Discuss each new FR (the stakeholder group championing the FR gets a chance to advocate it and be challenged)\n-  Overview of existing FRs\n-  Score the Cost of Delay\n\nTo score the Cost of Delay, all the FRs are listed in a grid, working through 1 column at a time. The WSJF is then calculated by dividing the Cost of Delay score by the FR's size.\n\nThe latest Product Backlog priorities should then be published to the business.\n\n-  Moving Features off the Backlog\n\nThe other Agile Scrum principle Measurabl could benefit from is the the Sprint Backlog.\n\nThe Product Backlog is list of FRs in order of priority awaiting to be developed. The WSJF only applies to the Product Backlog. The Sprint Backlog is the list of FRs that will be scheduled in the next Program Increment. It no longer requires prioritising and therefore no longer requires scoring.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89391/cZjO6rQGe3ryXQM0p4oDhlytSMcbN1AJCOV1UttO.png|alt=cZjO6rQGe3ryXQM0p4oDhlytSMcbN1AJCOV1UttO.png!The Product Team should go through the Discovery process of a FR while it is still in the Product Backlog, using the Backlog order to prioritise their work.\n\nIn the above example, FR 'c' went through the Discovery process but didn't make it to the Sprint Backlog as there was not enough capacity for it. The effort was not wasted as FR 'c' remained a high priority FR and made it to the Sprint Backlog the next time round.\n\nFRs should move from the Product backlog to a Sprint Backlog to fill up 60% of a Program Increment (4 bi-weekly sprints + a planning week). The large 40% contingency allows for emergency work as well as the fact that as FRs get refined they always grow in size. So if the Dev Team has a capacity of 100 points over 4 sprints, 60 points worth of FRs can be added to the Sprint Backlog.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89391/AwDFLo3XTyvMhUHXBjSdcNEdNOSFCEh68xq4quFb.png|alt=AwDFLo3XTyvMhUHXBjSdcNEdNOSFCEh68xq4quFb.png!During the planning week, User Stories get refined, grow in size and may also get broken down further. Dependencies are also taken into account when planning the Program Increment.\n\nThe Dev Team should therefore always know what they're working on 1 Program Increment at a time. That information should be published at the end of each planning week as the Dev Team should be committing to it. This is when expected release dates can be discussed with the stakeholders.\n\nThe process used for breaking FRs down into User Stories, refining them and scheduling them is out of the scope of the recommendations I am putting forward here, but would be the next item to look into should you proceed with the above.\n\nMeetings calendar example:\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/89391/6HLsKm4msOw81FN6K9pUiH5hNl4RScbeDpOBP4V9.png|alt=6HLsKm4msOw81FN6K9pUiH5hNl4RScbeDpOBP4V9.png!In summary:\n\nWhile I am not advocating Measurabl needs to move to a pure Agile Scrum framework (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development) because that's what I know, there are certainly some elements (how to manage the Product & Sprint backlogs) which I recommend and believe to be a good fit for Measurabl. Combining these with the current Kanban approach should improve the transparency and flexibility required when developing a SaaS Product.\n\nThe key principles are that the Product Team, with strategic direction from Matt, is responsible for the WHAT and the WHEN (prioritised Product Backlog and Sprint Planning) and the Dev Team is responsible for the HOW (which includes technologies and informing the Product Team with US sizing, technical dependencies and capacity).\n\nFurthermore, Agile does not meet no planning, quite the opposite: it's planning more frequently to be responsive to the business and market needs.\n\nWe should end up with 3 degrees of certainty: from low to high:\n\n-  The Roadmap\n-  High level (Epic), 12 months, driven by the company's strategy\n-  The Release Plan\n-  Medium level (Feature), 3 to 6 months, informed by the Product Backlog, with the backend open to changes\n-  The Program Increment\n-  Granular (User Story per Sprint), 2 months, committed as part of Sprint Planning\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

There's no specification on whether it should be Completed or In progress in the guidance, but I recommend In progress.\n--  To set this up, make the property type 'Other' in Measurabl and add a Initial Construction event that starts when the site is bought (or before 2016 if no bought date is provided) with no end date (still in progress).\n-  _Data Inclusion_\n\n--  Bought/Sold dates: data reported is the Absolute data for all owned months. For example, if a site is bought mid-Feb 2017, only the data for Feb through Dec 2017 is reported to GRESB. Note: In this scenario, all of Feb 2017 data will be included even if it was purchased Feb 28.\n--  Like-for-like data (LFL, L4L): LFL means that the same buildings were owned and operated for the entirety of both years (it's a way to get apples to apples) and is a subset of buildings from Absolute. In other words, Absolute is all buildings for a property type, the LfL is a subset of those buildings where we'd expect that data to be the same year over year and any change could be attributed to a change in usage rather than a change in ownership. So the more buildings in LfL, the closer the value will be to Absolute. If all the buildings in Absolute are also LfL, then the data will be equal in both columns.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

Stakeholder Backlog Swimlanes\n\nStakeholders are responsible for prioritizing and keeping your backlogs clean\n\nIt's up to you how you want to maintain your backlog and who you want to have help you. We recommend a process where you get your own stakeholders involved (eg talk to your teams and see which tickets are important to them).\n\n-  Pick your top 10-15 tickets and drag them to the top of your swimlane to help you keep track of important tickets.\n-  Grabbing tickets: Review other people’s swim lanes. If you see something you think should be higher rank then advocate for that with the Stakeholder. Or you can grab the ticket and put it in your swimlane if you want to advocate for it. You can also move a ticket in your swimlane to someone else's if you don't think it belongs in your swimlane. If you move tickets between swimlanes, be courteous and give the Stakeholder a heads-up slack to let them know.\n-  Champions: Label in the FR the champion as the person who asked for the ticket (eg Sean as champion for a Sales ticket, or Scott for a Science ticket). That way the champion can work with the Product Manager to refined the ticket and also attend prod comm.\n-  Pick the top 2-3 tickets you want to get scored. Tag as ‘Assign Product’ and I’ll assign a PM and will label as ‘Backlog Discovery'\n-  The Product Manager will help you refine your ticket and help you break it up into smaller tickets to get better dev tshirt estimate score\n\nh2. Dev Tshirt Estimate\n\nAfter the FR has been refined, the Stakeholder will move it into the swimlane for Dev estimate.\n\nDev will pick up those tickets and estimate them.\n\nh2. Prod Comm Scoring\n\n-  After it receives a Dev estimate, the ticket is ready for Prod Comm scoring.\n-  24/48 before meeting Sondra will post in general slack which tickets will be scored. Employees interested in those tickets will attend.\n-  After the meeting the FR scores will be posted in general slack\n\nh2. Prod Comm Scoring\n\n-  Scoring will be in gsheet using fibonacci sequence to weight.\n-  Each stakeholder gets a tab where they can enter their FR score.\n-  The average of those scores is then summed to create the Cost of Delay. CoD / Dev Estimate = ROI.\n-  The ticket is updated with the ROI and that is used to help determine prioritization in the Product and Dev queues.\n\nh2. Re-scoring\n\nPeriodically (tbd how often), tickets will be rescored for urgency/prioritization. Because tickets are scored unilaterally in this scoring process (as opposed to relative in WSJF method), individual tickets can be rescored if needed to prioritize them in the queue.\n\nh2. Bugs and one-off reqs\n\nAll requests for Dev support or changes that would be visible in the application, should be entered as an FR. Using FRs to track requests provides a standardized process that ensures full visibility and prompt attention, ideal allocation of resources, QA, and prioritization in line with all other work.\n\n-  The Stakeholder will appropriately tag the FR and escalate for immediate attention to Product and Dev.\n-  Bugs can skip over scoring (receive default bug score) to get immediately into Dev queue.

These users can be property or facility managers. They can be from different companies, for example PGIM owns properties managed by Greystone & FPI.\n\n--  Watch for big company names, competitors and industry leaders.\n-  *Existing INVITED User* - Same as above, but could be invited to another company, building group, etc.\n-  *Invitation ACCEPTED by User* - Good to keep an eye on these as the Invitee is now using the MSR app. Watch for those big names and take a look in the app to see what they are working on here. Could be a great upsell opportunity etc. More to come.\n\nOther things to watch for\n\n-  Bulk Site Upload Request - Especially if it is coming from a BASIC member. They are testing the platform and would probably be considered an MQL ready for interaction.\n-  ENERGY STAR Request - Good one to investigate, they are adding buildings and or services.

page,Gresb asset level upload,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""The Asset-level portal is finicky. It creates lots of errors if data goes outside of expected boundaries. One particular issue is that the PI1.0 question for which parts of the building are covered is only answered for Energy, there is not a way to answer for Water. That means that if you have a building with common area electric, but whole building water, you will encounter an error.\n\nRecommendation: Create a test reporting group in the GRESB sandbox portal and upload the asset-level data to the test group in the test portal first.

page,Xcel energy extraction discrepancies,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""h2. Background:\n\nXcel Energy is a big utility vendor in the Midwest and we have a lot of(~1000) accounts with this vendor. Xcel has always been in the top 3 vendors with issues such as gaps/overlaps/late-meters.\n\nhttps://www.xcelenergy.com/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcel_Energy\n\nh2. Data Extraction:\n\nUrjanet historically has been treating Xcel as a Summary bill vendor(2+ accounts in a single bill), where Xcel Energy's 'ACCOUNT NUMBER' was being presented as a 'Summary Account Number', and Xcel Energy's 'PREMISES NUMBER' was being presented as the 'Account Number'. We have been activating accounts based on this legacy form of extracting data - by adding in PREMISES NUMBER's.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88773/YhuWwftxFpUjnTooaKs2QgR92We7hqihFUkqkJra.png|alt=YhuWwftxFpUjnTooaKs2QgR92We7hqihFUkqkJra.png!!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88773/uRjDvvrGFPZbRWo8dePGK6AFwrqFPAK0Y8d5xjcE.png|alt=uRjDvvrGFPZbRWo8dePGK6AFwrqFPAK0Y8d5xjcE.png!## Change in Extraction Model:\n\nPOD - Commonly known as 'Point of Delivery' - _The point where facilities owned, leased or under license by a customer connect to the utility's facilities_.\n\nWe have never ingested POD into our system. When Urjanet changed their extraction model for all Xcel data to include POD, it caused a lot of noise in our system since there is a lot of historic data with the old/legacy extraction model and new data coming in the other way(POD/new model).\n\nh3.

Hence they have changed their templates to the new model. This change(legacy->new) was not formally communicated to Measurabl, which caused a lot of gaps/overlaps etc.\n\nh2. Proposed Fix:\n\nThere are two ways to fix this:\n\n-  In-house fix - start ingesting POD as a field - this would be a major structural change\n-  Outsource(Urjanet) - Custom Adapter - a specific piece of code written by Urjanet for Measurabl\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88773/cR8hCd8ucIiMVenBiFPY4cnO4orwuvUKmwBKfCKR.png|alt=cR8hCd8ucIiMVenBiFPY4cnO4orwuvUKmwBKfCKR.png!We are currently pursuing the Adapter Route - *more to come on this*.\n\nh2. Post Fix Cleanup:\n\nOnce we have a fix in place to get data consistently for Xcel energy, we will have to do a retro-cleanup project to iron out all the gaps/overlaps, *more to come on this*.\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"

Deals are stalling or we losing them at this point. We need to change the process. Hell, we need to build a process or a framework that we can easily follow. Think of it like learning to drive. At first we you to remember to do everything and you almost always forget a step, but if i ask you the mechanics of driving today; you know them and practice them without about them thinking at all.

Have an agenda, state it (or send in advance), ask if they agree, then proceed. This should be a nice 1-2pg deliverable like our new pricing page.\n\n2. Have a standard list of qualifying questions like “what does your portfolio consist of?” “What’s driving sustainability?” “What are your aspirations?” “Who is responsible for susty in your org today?” “Where is your data today?” “What would make you go ‘wow’ and want to start today?” “What are your biggest challenges”. All salespeople should *always* ask these! We are not getting our prospects to talk enough and we are not qualifying them well enough.\n\n3. Slow down. A lot of clicks were too fast and don’t display well over webinar.\n\n4. Close with more specific questions / directions about “what’s next” and how to get started. These should be addressed in the deliverable in #1\n"", :representation=>""storage""}}"
page,Zendesk integrations,"{:key=>""TETTRA""}","{:storage=>{:value=>""This wiki will guide you through the Zendesk Integrations that we chose to install within Zendesk in order to enhance the Customer Support Experience, both on the customer side and the agent side. This Tettra doc will be updated as we install more integrations.\n\nWhat is an *application integration*? - in a general context, this is the process of bringing resources from one application to another, often using middleware.\n\nWhy are these *useful*? - to streamline communication with customers *&* document detailed data involving these interactions in an organized way in order to enhance our reporting metrics.\n\nh2. Utilized Integrations\n\n-  *Slack for Zendesk Integration:* The integration enables Measurabl agents to create and interact with tickets from inside of Slack (viewing ticket notifications, creating new support tickets, commenting on existing tickets, channel configuration)\n\n--  For further guidance in using the Slack/Zendesk Integration: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001353047-Using-the-Slack-for-Zendesk-integration\n-  *User Data:* This displays information about the ticket requester and requester's organization. This includes tags, ticket activity, and contact, right next to a ticket. This can help us provide a more tailored response based off of past interaction history.\n\n--  For further guidance in using the UserData Integration: https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/user-data/\n-  *Delighted CSAT Survey:* Whenever a ticket is solved or closed in Zendesk, the Delighted Integration will send that ticket requester a CSAT Survey (Scale 1-5) to rate their experience with Measurabl Support. This is enabled by a trigger and URL Target set up in Zendesk. These triggers may be adjusted as needed. When a survey response is answered by a user, a ticket will be created in Zendesk with the User's name, information and response score. We are able to adjust the ticket creation based off whether it was any type of response, a dissatisfied response, neutral response, or satisfied response.\n\n--  For a full guide in using the Delighted Integration, from the agent view and the user experience view: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIpQ63CpAQoPkGAizT2yKIjHVK_Rtng1vb5KuCz41fg/edit\n-  *Knowledge Capture:* Ability to search the Knowledge Center without leaving the ticket. Insert links to relevant Help Center articles in ticket responses, create new articles while answering tickets.\n\n--  For further guidance in using the UserData Integration: https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/knowledge-capture/?source=app_directory\n-  *True AI:* This app gives smart recommendations to all incoming tickets and chats in Zendesk. It uses its artificial neural network to inspect and analyze historic conversations in the platform in order to provide the best available macros for a particular situation. The agent can simply select the most desired macro on the right-hand side of the ticket screen, and easily apply it to the ticket response.\n\n--  For further guidance in using the UserData Integration: https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/knowledge-capture/?source=app_directory\n\nh3. *To Access Integrations as an Agent:*\n\n-  Select the 'Apps' button in the top right-hand corner of an open ticket.\n\n!https://tettra-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/teams/37251/users/88720/L6WQmmDypzRxKcOziaRNjhttVcD1LxAlTYgdnoEl.png|alt=L6WQmmDypzRxKcOziaRNjhttVcD1LxAlTYgdnoEl.png!2.
